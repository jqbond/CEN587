The system is initially charged with an equimolar quantity of isobutane (A) and 1-butene (B).  Under these conditions, you may assume that all species are in the gas phase, and that all gases behave ideally. For kinetic reasons, it is desirable to run the reaction at as high a temperature as possible, but this might prevent a high conversion since the reactions are both exothermic. What is the maximum temperature that the reactor can operate and still achieve an isobutane conversion of 70\\%?"
