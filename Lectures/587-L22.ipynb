You can see this by comparing the value of the reaction quotient to the equilibrium constant.  The system is approaching equilibrium as the reactor reaches 150000L, and if we make the reactor much larger, the extra volume won't be useful for increasing conversion since the system is basically equilibrated and no further conversion is possible."
