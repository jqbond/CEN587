    "### Consider Maximixing Diphenyl Production as opposed to Benzene Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know (from **587-L22**) that we need a 403L PFR in order to achieve 50% conversion of Benzene.  A different question might be what volume *should* the reactor be.  As we discussed in class, that depends on our goal.  If it is to maximize Benzene conversion, then we would pick something like a 3000L reactor, where we reach the maximum allowable conversion of Benzene. In contrast, if our goal is to maximize the production of a certain compound, like diphenyl, we'd make a different choice. In fact, if we really wanted to maximize Diphenyl production, we'd probably want to stick with a reactor volume of about 400L because that is where the mole fraction of diphenyl is at a maximum.  This brings us to a discussion about the need for ***optimization*** in reactor design. This is the third type of numerical method we will use in this course (the first one being ***algebraic equation solvers*** like those in `opt.root()` or `opt.newton()` and the second one being ***ODE/Initial Value Problem solvers*** like those in `solve_ivp()`). There is a brief introduction to numerical methods for optimization (minimization) in **587-R08**, which considers volume and cost minimization by using a series of CSTRs instead of a single CSTR. "
