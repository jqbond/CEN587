    "We will define a quantity called the ***extent of reaction***.  Here we'll use a pretty loose definition and just say that the extent of reaction is a measure of how \"much\" reaction has occurred. For convenience (and compatibility with stoichiometric coefficients), we will define the extent of reaction in molar units.   \n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to note about the extent of reaction is that it is something that is specific to a *reaction, $i$*, it is not something that is specific to a *species, $j$*. Therefore, we will define the extent of reaction for a specific reaction, $i$. We use the symbol $\\xi_i$ to represent the extent of the $i^{th}$ reaction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\xi_i = \\textrm{moles of reaction $i$ that have occured}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If that is a bit too abstract, just consider that we often have many reactions to consider in a reacting systems.  Each reaction gets its own extent.  The index $i$ just corresponds to the number you've assigned that reaction in your network. \n",

    "We perform this reaction in a batch reactor that we initially charge with the following quantities of each species: $N_{A_0}$, $N_{B_0}$, and $N_{C_0}$.  We would like to describe how the quantity of each of those species changes as the reaction occurs; we can do so using the extent of reaction. For this particular example, this is the only reaction occuring, so we assign it the number 1.  We can then assign a specific extent for that reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\xi_1 = \\textrm{moles of reaction $1$ that have occured}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is an attribute of the reaction, not of a specific species.

Specifically, we know that every time this reaction occurs, it will:\n",

    "\n",

This quantity is going to be related to the extent of reaction, but unlike the extent of reaction, fractional conversion is specific to a *species* (whereas extents are specific to a *reaction*). As we've done with extents, it is frequently useful to expres the number of moles of reactant as a function of fractional conversion.  We can solve the above definition of fractional conversion for $N_A$ to find:\n",

This is a frequent approach in reactor design.  It is attractive for a few reasons, chief among them is that conversion, because it is a fractional quantity, always varies between 0 and 1.  Further, it is always positive. Finally, it is an ***intensive*** quantity that is independent of system size.  For these reasons, it is a more practical metric than reaction extent in terms of physical significance. \n",

In contrast, stating that our system achieves, e.g., 80\\% conversion is unambiguous and independent of scale.\n",
