# Recitations

This section includes all Recitations presented in a typical semester of undergraduate kinetics and reaction engineering. The general focus of these Recitation Exercises is:

1. Building programming skills
2. Learning Python
3. Understanding and applying numerical methods
4. Regression and statistics
5. Optimization 

All methods and necessary skills are built through analysis of example problems typical of an undergraduate course in kinetics and reaction engineering.
