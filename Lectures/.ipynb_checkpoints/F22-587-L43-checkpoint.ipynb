The volumetric flow rate of water into the CSTR is 233.1 ft$^3$/h, which is 2.5 times the methanol-propylene oxide volumetric flowrate.  The corresponding molar feed rates of methanol and water are 71.87 lb-mol/h and 802.8 lb-mol/h, respectively.  The water-propylene oxide-methanol mixgure undergoes a slight decrease in volume upon mixing (approximately 3\\%), but you can neglect this decrease in your calculations.  The temperature of both feed streams is 58$^\\circ$F prior to mixing, but there is an immediate 17$^\\circ$F temperautre rise upon mixing the two streames due to the heat of mixing.

We also have to allow for non-isothermal operation (a change in temperature from feed to exit), so we will write an energy balance on the CSTR.  The most general and straightforward approach is to just write balances on all species plus one energy balance.\n",
