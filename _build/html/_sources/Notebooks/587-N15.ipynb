    "\n",
    "A batch reactor is a closed system.  It is initially charged with some quantity of reactants, products, solvents, catalysts, etc. at some temperature, pressure, and composition. Thereafter, there is no flow of material into or out of the reactor (although exchange of energy with the surroundings is permitted). Typically, we imagine starting a reaction at $t = 0$, and then we allow the reaction to occur as time progresses. This is not a flow process, and batch reactors do not operate at steady state (steady state in a batch reactor means that the reaction has reached completion or equilibrium such that composition is no longer changing). When we discuss batch reactors, we usually will think about how the characteristics of the batch reactor and the reaction media inside of the batch reactor ***change as a function of time***. Mass conservation requires that, for a closed system, the total mass inside of the system is invariant with time. Element conservation also applies, so the atomic quantities of elements will also not change with time. However, as the reaction occurs, the nature of that mass and elements will change since reactants are generally converting into products. In fact, for a batch reactor, total mass and atomic quantities of elements are pretty much the only things that are fixed. When working with a batch reactor, as time elapses, we should generally expect that:\n",

    "### Applications of Batch Reactors\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch reactors tend to be a bit more labor intensive since they require startup, shutdown, product recovery, cleaning/decontamination, re-charging, etc. They are commonly used for exploratory research with liquid- or gas-phase reactions at small scales. Often, we study kinetics in the laboratory using batch reactors. This allows us to develop functions that tell us how intensive rates of reactions vary with temperature, pressure, and composition. Once we have developed these ***rate laws***, they are applicable universally, and we can use them to scale the process to larger reactors. Batch reactors are also used industrially for the production of things that do not scale well to continuous flow. Some examples might be very high value products (like pharmaceuticals) that are produced in very small quantities. In these cases, it may not be practical to run a process continuously, and the industry is better served by using a batch reactor to produce small quantities in multiple batches throughout the year. Processes that use expensive homogeneous catalysts (organometallic complexes, enzymes, etc.) are also sometimes carried out in batch processes because it is impractical to continuously flow expensive catalysts in solution and subsequently try to recover them from the reactor effluent. In these cases, it is may be better to work in batch systems. Another example could be biological processes, such as those involving microbial fermentation. Fermentation in the food and beverage industry, beer-brewing, for example is usually performed in batch reactors.  "

We will work through a useful simplification that applies only for constant volume batch reactors. In addition to being widely used for analysis of laboratory and kinetic data, this is a useful example because it introduces the idea that you can manipulate differential equations (and transform the differential variables therein) to suit the system that you are considering.

Finally, unless we know specifically that the reactor is at steady state, the quantity of each species may change with time, so the accumulation term is non-zero. This idea tends to confuse students at first because they are used to thinking about flow reactors at steady state in material balence courses, but imagine a bucket with a hole in it. At time = 0, the bucket is empty, and you turn on a faucet to fill the bucket. The level of water will increase (i.e., there is accumulation of water) until the system reaches a point where inflow and outflow are balanced (there is no reaction when you're filling a bucket with water, so $G_j = 0$). At that point, the amount of water in the bucket stops changing, flow in equals flow out, there is no more net accumulation of water, and the system is at steady state. But it takes some time for this to happen! We will encouter a similar scenario any time we start up or shut down a flow reactor--the flow reactor will operate away from steady state during these times.

Since the exit pipe is basically removing a sample of the fluid from the CSTR, so this means that the temperature, pressure, and composition in the exit stream is exactly the same as the temperature, pressure, and composition inside of the fluid phase within the reactor.

A PFR is basically an empty tube through which the reacting fluid is flowing---there is absolutely no mixing in a Plug Flow Reactor.  The core assumption for the PFR is that the fluid flows through at a relatively high Reynolds number ($\\mathrm{Re} > 10^3$).  This generally ensures that the fluid moves through the reactor in a turbulent flow regime.  This is convenient from a reactor modelling perspective because it means that (if we consider an axial cross section of the reactor), the velocity profile is flat, i.e., all fluid in that cross section has an identical average velocity. Constrast this with a Laminar Flow Regime where we assume there is a parabolic velocity profile (See Figure Below).\n",

So: everything ***in a single reactor cross section must be completely uniform in terms of temperature, pressure, and composition***. That said, as we move from one cross section of the reactor to the next cross section travelling down the length of the reactor, the temperature, pressure, and composition will probably change. There is no mixing between cross sections, a PFR behaves like an infinite series of isolated, well-mixed axial slices, and we find that temperature, pressure, and composition vary as one moves from one axial slice to the next down the length (through the volume) of a PFR."
