    "We want to know, based on that data, what is the rate law and corresponding kinetic parameters (k, reaction order, etc.) that best describe that data. With an inverse problem, we have to extract that information from the data. Since this reaction is overall (not an elementary step), at best, we can propose that the rate of reaction depends on temperature (which we capture with a rate constant) and the concentration of the reactant, A, with some unknown order, i.e., we'll propose a power law model:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = R_A$$\n",

    "At this point, we make a decision about whether we want to use a **differential** method of analysis, where we attempt to approximate reaction rates by taking numerical derivatives of data, or an **integral** method of analysis, where we attempt to solve the material balance by integration and then regress parameters in the resultant model that best describe our data.  \n",

    "1. Numerical differentiation is imprecise, and especially so when considering large changes in concentration/time\n",

    "As the name suggests, integral analysis of batch reactor data is based on integration, which entails solving the differential equation that comprises the batch reactor material balance.  Recall from above that we were able to develop the following ODE that describes the change in the concentration of species a with respect to time -- remember that at this point this is done symbolically for an arbitrary rate constant, $k$, and an arbitrary reaction order $\\alpha$.  As of now, we do not know either of their values, so we leave them symbolic in the material balance.\n",

Although somewhat tedious, the most straightfoward approach is to assume a reaction order and then check to see if that model describes the measured data. As we'll see below, this can be time consuming, but it has the added advantage of letting us compare multiple models, which can help to inform our decision about which one describes our data the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, let's assume that the reaction order is either 0, 1, or 2.  Once we do that, we can solve the material balance on A to get an analytical solution for $C_A(t)$, which we can compare to our data.\n",

    "Now we have the opposite problem compared to the zero order case -- the second order model under-predicts concentration at short times, and it over-predicts their values at long times.  This is a sign that the order it too high.  Clearly, the first order model is \"just right\" here as it is the one that fits the data best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we've used \"nonlinear\" regression because the models that we fit for first order and second order were non-linear functions of time.  This is a powerful technique but it can also lead to problems.  Most notably, when have data that is nonlinear, it is supposed to be curved in some way.  It can be hard to tell if the amount of curvature is correct.  In this case, it is easy to see, but recall that this is actually a perfect data set that I generated by solving a first order system.  When we have messy, \"real\" data, it can be difficult to tell if the type of curvature observed in your model is correct, and it can be hard to resolve whether one nonlinear model is better than the other.\n",

    "3. They key here is that linear regression solutions are deterministic.  There **is** a unique solution for the parameters that give us the best fit if we use linear regression. \n",
    "4. With nonlinear regression (as above), we are forced to use interative optimization routines like `opt.minimize()` or `opt.minimize_scalar()`, which are not necessarily guaranteed to converge.  The linear algebra solutions will be much more stable, which can be very beneficial in difficult optimization problems.\n",

In general, the precision of our estimates by regression decreases as we estimate more parameters.  So, for an optimization where I already know a parameter, $C_{A0}$ in this case, it's probably best if I don't introduce uncertainty by regressing a parameter whose value I'm sure of.  How could you fix it at the known quantity?\n",

Y, in this case, is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_A}{C_{A0}}\\right)$, and A is only a single coefficient, namely the slope of the line.  See below for implementation.  We can't use polyfit here, but if we know how to work with the vandermonde matrix, we have a lot of flexibility in regressions.  This is similar to what you can do with the LINEST function in Excel."
