    "We frequently need to store many quantities inside of some type of collection. If we're going to work in Python, we might choose to do this using ***lists*** or ***numpy arrays***, so it is important to understand the differences between them.  It is easy to confuse these two types of data structures since they look similar, and we create them in similar ways.  But they have important differences.  We will ***usually*** prefer to work with numpy arrays in this course, but it is important for us to understand lists for several reasons. First, to understand why a numpy array is preferred for the types of things we do in 587, we need to first understand how lists work; this takes some of the mystery out of deciding which type of structure we should work with. Second, we (often) construct numpy arrays using lists as inputs. Finally, there are many packages in Python that will use lists as their default input or output structure for data, so we should be familiar with them.\n",
