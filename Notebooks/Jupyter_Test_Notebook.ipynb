    "If you're new to Jupyter Notebooks but you have some experience in something like Matlab, the first thing that you'll notice is that it does not look like a classic IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that you'd have with any sort of universal code editor like VS Code, or even with the GUI environment for Matlab.  If you're more old school, there will be no separate writing code in a text editor and then compiling and running code from the command line. In a Jupyter Notebook, everything is done in the Notebook environment, which breaks your \"program\" down into cells of varying types: Code, Markdown, or RawNBConvert. For teaching purposes, I use Code and Markdown cells exclusively, but you may at some point find the NBConvert helpful if you want to translate content into LaTeX or HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with Markdown, it is a lightweight, easy to use markup language.  Writing in Markdown will *feel* similar to a barebones word processor, with maybe a bit of HTML or LaTeX for special formatting--it also allows you to embed images. For me, having Markdown cells that support nicely formatted text is useful in that, once your Notebooks are fully developed, they are effectively a textbook-quality resource that can include figures and nicely formatted equations *with* embedded code demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find a purpose-built Notebook (written by the instructor to teach a specific topic) is far more accessible than a typical Chemical Engineering textbook, and students really appreciate having the resource to learn from asynchronously.  We will discuss Markdown a bit during the workshop to showcase some of its capabilities and how it can be useful for teaching, but for now, it will suffice that you know that there is a Markdown environment in a Jupyter Notebook, and that it allows you to present anything that isn't code in order to support and explain your code."
