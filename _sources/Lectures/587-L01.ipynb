    "* Reactions are at the core of chemical and biological processes that we use in industry to convert natural resources (raw materials) into value-added products (fuels, chemicals, pharmaceuticals). Our basic requirement is that we turn a low-value raw material into something that has a higher value to society. For example, making high octane gasoline from crude oil or polyethylene from natural gas.  These processes depend on our ability to perform chemical reactions.  \n",

    "* These reactions are carried out in chemical or biological reactors\n",

    "* You've been studying chemical reactions for years. They all have intrinsic properties that determine how we will need to design reactors. All of these properties will effect how we design the reactor to achieve our stated goals. Reactions may generally:\n",

    " * Happen at different rates and on different time scales (size reactors accordingly!) \n",
    " * Produce toxic or low-value byproducts \n",

    "## Chemical Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "A chemical reaction is a transformation of one or more atoms and/or molecules. It involves breaking existing chemical bonds between atoms and/or forming new chemical bonds between atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple, but important concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider dehydrogneation of isobutane to form isobutene and hydrogen:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_4H_{10} \\ (g) \\leftrightharpoons C_4H_8 \\ (g) + H_2 \\ (g)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a balanced chemical equation; it tells us exactly the stoichiometry of reaction, i.e., the quantities of reactants consumed and products formed in a given reaction.  In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 \\ \\textrm{molecule} \\ C_4H_{10} \\ (g) \\leftrightharpoons 1 \\ \\textrm{molecule} \\ C_4H_8 \\ (g) + 1 \\ \\textrm{molecule} \\ H_2 \\ (g)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, in molar units (since we don't generally like quantifying molecules in industrial practice):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 \\ \\textrm{mole} \\ C_4H_{10} \\ (g) \\leftrightharpoons 1 \\ \\textrm{mole} \\ C_4H_8 \\ (g) + 1 \\ \\textrm{mole} \\ H_2 \\ (g)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation represents a balanced chemical reaction, which communicates the requirement that elements are conserved from the reactant state to the product state. In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$4C + 10H \\leftrightharpoons 4C + 8H + 2H$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we see a clear demonstration of mass conservation, (i.e., the total mass of a system is conserved during a reaction) if we consider the balanced reaction, where we use the molar mass of each species to convert its molar quantity into mass units:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$58.12\\textrm{g} \\ C_4H_{10} \\ (g) \\leftrightharpoons 56.11\\textrm{g} \\ C_4H_8 \\ (g) + 2.01\\textrm{g} \\ H_2 \\ (g)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some things that we notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Total mass is conserved (mass on the left hand side mass on the right hand side)\n",
    "2. Total number of atoms are conserved (Number of C's and H's on left hand side and right hand side are equal)\n",
    "3. Total number of moles of each species is not conserved\n",
    "4. The nature of the mass changes upon chemical reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in the course of a chemical reaction, we conserve the total mass and total number of each element; however, the chemical nature of the species will change so that the mass and elements are distributed in different forms on the left hand side and right hand side of a balanced equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping track of the quantities of each species and how they change over the course of a reaction is a critical part of reactor design.  We accomplish this using **material balances**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, we know that the energy of the system is conserved during a chemical reaction. An exothermic reaction may release energy into its environment; an endothermic reaction may absorb energy from its environment, but the total energy of the system is conserved.  As with moles of species, it only changes forms (e.g., kinetic energy of the system manifested as temperature vs. potential energy in chemical bonds)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dehydrogenation reaction, for example, is endothermic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_4H_{10} (g) \\leftrightharpoons C_4H_8 (g) + H_2 (g) \\ \\ \\textrm{where} \\ \\ \\Delta H = 115 \\ \\textrm{kJ} \\ \\textrm{mol}^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reaction occurs without external heat input, temperature must decrease.  If one wants to maintain isothermal conditions, heat must be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature critically affects chemical reactions.  For reversible reactions (i.e., those that are somehow equilibrium limited), changing the temperature will usually affect the extent of reaction one can achieve.  Alternatively, reaction rates have a very strong dependence on reaction temperature, so it is critically important that we understand how the temperature in our reactor changes as we perform a reaction.  This is done through **energy balances**."

    "## Stoichiometry: Formally\n",
    "\n",

Accordingly, we can rewrite the above reaction as an equation, specifically a linear combination of species multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients:\n",
