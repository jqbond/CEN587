# Welcome to CEN 587!

This is the course web site for CEN 587 at Syracuse University.  It compiles all content from Python supplements, lectures, and weekly recitations.

This course is an undergraduate-level course in Kinetics and Chemical Reaction Engineering. It is based mostly on content from *Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering* by Scott Fogler and *Chemical Reactor Analysis and Design Fundamentals* by Jim Rawlings and John Ekerdt. The presentation and approach--especially the early introduction of programming and numerical methods--are heavily influenced by Jim Rawlings. Each supplement, lecture, or recitation is comprised of a Jupyter Notebook that includes text-based explanations and development of key concepts and equations. Solutions are generally presented in code cells using Python. The way the material is presented was inspired by John Kitchin.

```{caution}
Multiple example problems throughout my notes were either taken directly from in-chapter examples in the above mentioned textbooks (Rawlings and Ekerdt, Fogler) or otherwise they may be modified forms of those problems. I haven't added proper citations to each example problem yet, but I am working on correcting this.
