    "\n",
    "Here, though, we're not so lucky to have a constant density fluid, so we need to calculate it.  We'll do so by assuming an ideal solution in which volumes are additive.  So, if we know the volumetric flowrates of each species, $Q_j$, we simply sum them up to get the total volumetric flowrate, $Q$.\n",

So, for this problem we have 4 unknowns and only one equation.  We can either write more equations, or we can reduce the number of unknowns.  I'll chose the second approach here because it is an algebraic equation, and it is usually easer to deal with the smallest set of unknowns possible. Also, the exit fractional conversion is specified in this problem. Since this process involves only one reaction, this means that I can easily solve for exit flowrates of all species based on the conversion of $B$ attained in the reactor.\n",
