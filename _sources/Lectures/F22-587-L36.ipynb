    "Just from a simple, visual analysis, we can see that the data have a shape that could be attributed to an MM Mechanism.  At low concentrations, rate increases strongly with increasing concentration, and then at high concentrations, it seems that the rate is not responding very much to changing concentrations.  We haven't done anything rigorous yet, but this would be consistent with an MM Mechanism, where we observe first order kinetics at low substrate concentrations and zero order kinetics at high substrate concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to overlay model predictions with the measured data to see how well the rate is doing, but I need some estimates for the parameters to do that.  We can get a rough idea of the parameter values by looking at limiting behavior.  Specifically, at high substrate concentrations, we know that $K_M << [U]$, so at the limit of very high urea concentration, we should see that:\n",

    "$$r = V_\\textrm{max}$$\n",

    "$$V_\\textrm{max} \\approx  1.08 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{L}^{-1} \\ \\textrm{s}^{-1}$$\n",

    "Is that concentration high enough that $K_M$ is truly $<< [U]$?  Probably not.  But this is a far better way to approach it than to blindly guess values of $K_M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we look at low concentration data, say rates measured at 0.002 and 0.005 mol/L, we can say in this regime that (probably) $K_M >> [U]$.  At that limit, we find:\n",

    "$$r = \\frac{V_\\textrm{max}}{K_M}[U]$$\n",
