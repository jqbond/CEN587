    "Ethyl Nitrate ($C_2H_5O\\!N\\!O_2$) undergoes pyrolysis in the gas phase to form formaldehyde ($C\\!H_2O$), methyl nitrite ($C\\!H_3N\\!O_2$), and nitrogen dioxide ($N\\!O_2$)\n",

    "The reaction is thought to be initiated by a homolytic bond scission to form an ethoxy radical ($C_2H_5O^\\bullet$) and nitrogen dioxide ($N\\!O_2$). Radicals are very reactive species, and once the ethoxy species forms, it continues to react further, forming other radicals, which then initiate sequential reactions, one of which forms methyl nitrate.  Ultimately, the recombination of 2 ethoxy radicals is thought to form acetaldehyde and ethanol.  The mechanism is described in a set of elementary steps below.  In this mechanism, we have assumed that all of the reactions are irreversible.\n",

    "### Solution to Example Problem 01\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement asks us to develop an expression for the rate of methyl nitrate formation, so we'll start here.  In the mechanism, methyl nitrate ($CH_3NO_2$) is only formed in step 3, thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{CH_3NO_2} = r_3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We further note that the rate of methyl nitrate formation must be equal to the overall rate of reaction (since it is a product of ethyl nitrate decomposition, i.e., 1 ethyl nitrate is consumed to form 1 methyl nitrate).  Therefore, the overall rate of reaction is equal to the rate of step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = r_3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can work with the rate of step 3 to develop an expression for the overall rate of reaction here.  Let's begin by writing that rate expression, which we can do by inspection since these are elementary steps.  Note that I am using bracket notation to express concentrations.  I'm doing this because the chemical formulas are a bit long and complex, and they are klunky as subscrits on concentrations, so I'm opting for this notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = r_3 = k_3\\left[{CH_3}^\\bullet \\right]\\left[{C_2H_5ONO_2} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As often happens with the analysis of reaction mechanisms, we find that the reaction rate is a function of a reactive intermediate. In this case, it is a methyl radical ($CH_3^\\bullet$).  This is inconvenient because we cannot really purchase, measure, control, etc. the concentration of the methyl radical.  So this isn't a particularly useful rate expression.  We would prefer to have that rate expressed as a function of concentrations of stable species that are observable in the gas phase.  These are our reactants and products in the overall reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To eliminate reactive species from the rate expression, we generally make approximations that allow us to express their concentrations in terms of concentrations of stable species.  Radicals generally meet the requirements of a \"reactive intermediate\" in the context of the PSSH.  They are difficult to form (slow kinetics of formation), and they are very reactive, so they generally are consumed quickly (fast kinetics of consumption). They are also usually thermodynamically not very favorable, so they are pretty much guaranteed to be present at low concentrations.  For these reasons, it is not a bad approximation to say that the concentration of radical intermediates is not changing as a function of time; in other words, their net rate of formation is exactly equal to their net rate of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll apply the PSSH to the methyl radical and see where that gets us. As I'm doing this, I'm going to view the concentration of any radical as an \"unknown\" that I'm looking to solve for in terms of measurable species (stable reactants and products) and/or kinetic parameters (rate constants):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{{CH_3}^\\bullet} = 0 = r_2 - r_3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to keep that equation in mind because it may be useful (which I'll demonstrate later).  To move further, we need to see what is buried in each of those elementary rate expressions, so we expand $r_2$ and $r_3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{{CH_3}^\\bullet} = 0 = k_2\\left[{C_2H_5O}^\\bullet \\right] - k_3\\left[{CH_3}^\\bullet \\right]\\left[{C_2H_5ONO_2} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we write this out, we see that making the PSSH on the methyl radical has introduced a new \"unknown\" into the system, specifically the concentration of the ethoxy radical (${C_2H_5O}^\\bullet$).  Because of this, we can't yet solve for the concentration of the methyl radical in terms of only stable species.  To eliminate the concentration of the ethoxy radical, we apply the PSSH again, this time to the ethoxy radical:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{{C_2H_5O}^\\bullet} = 0 = r_1 - r_2 + r_3 - 2r_4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep that equation in mind in case it is useful later, but we also have to figure out what other radical concentrations are buried in those elementary rate equations before we can solve this.  Expanding each rate expression, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{{C_2H_5O}^\\bullet} = 0 = k_1\\left[{C_2H_5ONO_2} \\right] - k_2\\left[{C_2H_5O}^\\bullet \\right] + k_3\\left[{CH_3}^\\bullet \\right]\\left[{C_2H_5ONO_2} \\right] - 2k_4\\left[{C_2H_5O}^\\bullet \\right]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect!  In writing that PSSH statement, we have not introduced any new radical concentrations, so what we have now is a system of 2 equations (PSSH on ${CH_3}^\\bullet$ and on ${C_2H_5O}^\\bullet$) written in two unknowns, namely the concentrations of the methyl and ethoxy radicals ($\\left[{CH_3}^\\bullet \\right]$ and $\\left[{C_2H_5O}^\\bullet \\right]$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these system can actually get pretty messy because of all of the terms.  I advise against jumping into something like a substitution method straightaway.  Instead, let's recall that we have two forms of these equations.  We have the complicated, full expansions of each PSSH statement:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "    \n",
    "It can be tempting to start trying to solve for the radical concentrations in the above form, but it is easy to go in circles with a substitution method here.  A better first step is often to find combinations of the PSSH equations that allow us to cancel as many terms as possible before trying to work with a substitution method. For me, it is usually easiest to see the right combinations if I instead work with these equations (which are equivalent to the above):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\n",
    "$$0 = r_1 - 2r_4$$\n",

    "First, we would write a standard production rate expression for ethylene, $C_2H_4$.  Conveniently, it only appears in a single step, so:\n",

    "\n",
    "And we find ourselves in the usual position of needing to express the concentration of a reactive intermediate, the ethyl radical (${C_2H_5}^\\bullet$) in terms of stable species.  We start by writing a PSSH expression on the ethyl radical:\n",
