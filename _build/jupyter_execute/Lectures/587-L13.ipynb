    "## Rate Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point, we have learned that, for homogeneous reactions, we will always compute the Extensive generation/consumption rate for species $j$, $G_j$ by scaling the intensive production rate, $R_j$, in units of moles per volume to the volume of the reactor, $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G_j = \\int^V R_jdV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a well-mixed reactor, this simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G_j = R_jV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recall that we compute the intensive production rate of species $j$ by summing contributions from individual reactions, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_j = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N_R} \\nu_{i,j} \\, r_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have *not* talked about what $r_i$ is, though.  That is a topic for a focused discussion on kinetics, which we'll touch on in Chapter 5 and would also be covered in most graduate-level courses on physical chemistry, kinetics, or catalysis.  For our purposes, we only need to think of the reaction rate, $r_i$ as some function that tells us how quickly a given reaction occurs for a specific combination of Temperature, Pressure, and Species composition. We will call these functions ***rate laws*** or ***rate expressions***, and they are what will allow us to calculate the reaction rate under any conditions that our reactor is operating.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_i = f(T, P, \\chi_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless rate expressions, but there are some common ways that we'll discuss them.  In this course, we will usually describe composition dependencies in terms of concentrations, $C_j$. For certain reactions, we may also use partial pressures, $p_j$.  This is common for gas-phase reactions, and it should make physical sense as well because partial pressures are easily related to concentrations, e.g., for an ideal gas:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_j = \\frac{p_j}{RT}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate Constants and Temperature Dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a rate constant to capture the temperature dependence of the reaction.  When we use rate constants in this course, we assume that we will always be able to capture their temperature dependence using an Arrhenius expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_i = A_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_{A_i}}{RT}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $A_i$ is an Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, and $E_A$ is the activation barrier for the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reaction Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we will discuss composition dependencies in terms of reaction order:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a reaction is \"first order in A\", we'll generally write $r = kC_A$. If it is second order in A, we would write $r = k{C_A}^2$.  If it is first order in A and second order in B, we would write $r = kC_A{C_B}^2$. We will generally need to be told what the reaction orders and rate constants are, or otherwise we'll have to be provided data that allows us to estimate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reversible Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "When a reaction can proceed in either the forward or the reverse direction, we have to account for the rates of both of those processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\rightleftharpoons B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we do this by writing a net rate of reaction, which is the difference between forward and reverse reaction rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = r_f - r_r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall vs. elementary reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "For a generic *overall* reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nu_A A + \\nu_B B \\rightleftharpoons \\nu_C C + \\nu_D D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We **CANNOT** define a rate law by inspection of stoichiometry.  At best, we can propose that the rate of that reaction may depend on all of the species participating in that reaction with some unknown reaction order.  So if you have to propose a hypothetical rate law for the overall reaction above, we could only say something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k{C_A}^\\alpha {C_B}^\\beta {C_C}^\\gamma {C_D}^\\delta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the exponents represent unknown reaction orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rare event we are working with an elementary step, or if we are told that the reaction \"has an elementary rate law\", then we know the reaction occurs exactly as written, and we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k_f{C_A}^{\\nu_A} {C_B}^{\\nu_B} - k_r{C_C}^{\\nu_C} {C_D}^{\\nu_D}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex kinetics\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no guarantee we will have a simple power law model of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k{C_A}^\\alpha {C_B}^\\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, especially for catalytic and enzymatic reactions, we will observe more complex rate laws. A common example is something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{k {C_A} {C_B}}{1 + K_A{C_A} + K_B{C_B}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although rate laws can actually become very complicated, for our purposes, they always accomplish the same thing---they are simply functions.  We pass them Temperatures, Pressures, and Compositions as arguments, and they return the value of the intensive reaction rate.  We then use this to compute species production rates, $R_j$, and the overall extensive rate of production by chemical reaction, $G_j$."
