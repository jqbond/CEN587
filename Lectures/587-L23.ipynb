    "### Consider Maximixing Diphenyl Production as opposed to Benzene Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know (from L21) that we need a 403L PFR in order to achieve 50% conversion of Benzene.  A different question might be what volume *should* the reactor be.  As we discussed in class, that depends on our goal.  If it is to maximize Benzene conversion, then something like a 3000L reactor...but if it is to maximize the production of a certain compound, like diphenyl, we'd make a different choice. In fact, if we really wanted to maximize Diphenyl production, we'd probably want to stick with a reactor volume of about 400L because that is where the mole fraction of diphenyl is at a maximum.  This leads us into a discussion about ***optimization***, which is the third type of numerical method we will use in this course (the first one being ***algebraic equation solvers*** like those in `opt.root()` or `opt.newton()` and the second one being ***ODE/Initial Value Problem solvers*** like those in `solve_ivp()`). We will take a look at numerical methods for optimization (minimization) in Recitation 08 on Thursday. "

    "An important question is clearly what space time do we need to use to maximize the yield to species B (the intermediate in the series reaction).  From the graph of Yield vs. tau, we can see this occurs at a space time of about 3 hours.  To get more precise, we can either solve it analytically by taking a derivative of $Y_{B/A}$ with respect to tau; after some calculus and algebra, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dY_{B/A}}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_1(1 + k_1\\tau)(1 + k_2\\tau) - k_1\\tau\\left[k_1(1 + k_2\\tau) + k_2(1 + k_1\\tau)\\right]}{\\left[(1 + k_1\\tau)(1+k_1\\tau)\\right]^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimum value of tau, we solve the following expression for $\\tau$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = \\frac{k_1(1 + k_1\\tau)(1 + k_2\\tau) - k_1\\tau\\left[k_1(1 + k_2\\tau) + k_2(1 + k_1\\tau)\\right]}{\\left[(1 + k_1\\tau)(1+k_1\\tau)\\right]^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this by hand to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau_{\\textrm{opt}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{k_1k_2}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which we can plug into a calculator to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau_{\\textrm{opt}} = 3.16 \\ \\textrm{h}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you know, we could just create an objective function (return negative yield of B at a specific volume) and minimize that with an optimization routine.  See below.  You get the same answer."
