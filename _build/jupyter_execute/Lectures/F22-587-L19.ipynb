    "Here, though, we're not so lucky to have a constant density fluid, so we need to calculate it.  We'll do so by assuming an ideal solution in which volumes are additive.  With that in mind, for an ideal mixture, we assume volumes are additive.  So, if we know the volumetric flowrates of each species, $Q_j$, we simply sum them up to get the total volumetric flowrate, $Q$.\n",

I'll chose the second approach here because it is an algebraic equation, and it is usually easer to deal with the smallest set of unknowns possible.\n",
