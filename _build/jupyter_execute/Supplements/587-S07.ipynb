    "Functions are some of the most useful classes of objects in any high level programming language, and Python is no exception!  In very basic terms, a function accepts inputs, performs operations on them, and returns outputs.  The classic idea we all have of a function is something like y is a function of x for example,\n",

    "This is a simple *univariate scalar* function. We call it univariate because it has only one argument (x).  We call it scalar because for a given input of x, it returns a single output value for y. But we will see in a moment that functions are far more general and flexible.  In Python, we follow a few important rules to define a function. "

    "## Function syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, the most traditional way to declare a function is with the **def** keyword, and you always use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(inputs):\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Where `function_name` can be anything you want it to be, and `inputs` can be zero, one, or more arguments that you will provide to the function in order for it to perform its operations. Of the parts you see here, the only things that are non negotiable in this type of function definition are `def` and `:` \n",
    "\n",
    "**The next bit is important:** Every line after the first one in the function (the one with `def` and `:` in it), all the way up to the end of your function, *must be indented from the left margin*. This is the same syntax as `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops. If a line is indented beyond the `def` keyword, that means that line is inside of the function's scope.  Once you return to the left margin, you are no longer writing code inside of that function. Python uses indentation to define a function scope instead of something like an **end** keyword that you see in many languages. In Python, indentation is what distinguishes a bit of code from being inside of a function (or loop) and being outside of that function (or loop). Typically a good editor will auto-indent the next line for you once it sees a : at the end of a line.  Jupyter, for example, does this by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{info}\n",
    "If you want a function to accept an input from you, you have to specify which inputs you will give it.  Conversely, if you want it to return an output, you will need to tell it which outputs to return. If you do not specify what the function returns in Python, it will return the last thing computed by the function as the default return.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above rules and caveats in mind, in the cells below, we create a function called `y1` that accepts an argument (an input), which is called `x` locally inside of the function. It uses that value of `x` to perform the required operations, and it returns the value of `result` as an output.  We also will go ahead an import the packages we will need later in this module. Function definitions themselves are part of base Python, but we'll also need `numpy`, `pyplot`, and `random` to complete the exercises in this module."

    "## How much damage will a magic battle axe do against a Lich anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll travel to the legit game world, where you are up against something super gnarly. Let's say a very old Lich. Ok, let's just say you're fighting Acererak from Tomb of Horrors. The dude is straight up bad news. \n",
    "\n",
    "After a pitched battle, everyone in your guild is down *except for you*. You aren't in great shape, but as far as you can tell, neither is Acererak. He looks rough ***even by lich standards***, and you are pretty sure that he's on his last legs. Some back of the envelope estimation (out of game) suggests that Acererak has about 28 hit points remaining, give or take. You have a magic great axe that has *Lichslayer III* written in Dwarven on the handle. Acererak's physical armor is falling apart, and you swear you saw his mage armor flicker out of existence like 3 rounds ago. You're a 19th level berserker, so you have a great chance to hit...the question is whether it will do enough damage to put Acererak down. It is all down to this roll - you're up in initiative, and if you can beat 28, he's done for...but if you don't and he gets to return fire...he can hit you at will and pretty much take you down with a cantrip. It's...risky. Discretion may be the better part of valor? Do you drag your comrades along and head for the sunlight, or do you swing the axe?  Boy, it'd be nice to know what to expect on that damage roll.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to see if we can gauge our chances a bit by figuring out an average damage roll for *Lichslayer III*.  We'll assume you'll hit because you're a 19th level berserker and he basically has no armor left. Your great axe does 4d12+5 base damage and then 2d4+2 bonus damage against Liches (because, *Lichslayer III*). The way this works is you roll your dice sets individually, add any modifiers, and then sum everything up to calculate your total damage roll.  For example, 4d12+5, if we rolled a 12 on each of our 4 dice, would give a total base damage of 53. 2d4+2, if we rolled 4 on each of our dice, would give bonus damage of 10. Add those together, that's 63 and plenty to drop Acererak. But then, it's pretty rare to ace on all of those dice, and there is a good chance your roll comes out much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just for kicks, let's use a while loop to figure out the average result of that damage roll. This is basically the core of a monte carlo simulation - as a computer experiment, we will roll the dice (4d12+5 and 2d4+2) virtually and calculate the damage total. But we are actually interested in calculating the mean value by repeating the damage roll a number of times and then calculating the mean damage from all of our rolls. The thing we have to realize is that we will not approach the true mean until we repeat the damage roll many, many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this doesn't quite make sense, imagine flipping a quarter 4 times...there is a good chance you don't get heads twice and tails twice, even though the probability of either roll is 1/2. If you flip the coin 100,000 times though, you will approach 50,000 heads and 50,000 tails, which is what you'd expect based on probability of the two outcomes. So the question I want to answer is how many times we need to make that damage roll before we get a reasonable approximation for the average of 4d12+5 + 2d4+2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fun example, but we really are just running a simulation until it coverges, and similar techniques are at the core of various simulations you might use in research, statistics, or data analysis. We are just going to use a while loop to continue increasing the number of damage rolls we make until the mean we get is no longer changing relative to our best current estimate of the mean. At that point, our simulation has converged, and we will consider this a pretty good approximation for our mean damage roll. \n",
    "\n",
    "As usual with a while loop, we have to set a convergence threshold.  I'll say that I'm happy if the specific experiment I've just run (making the damage roll \"n\" times and taking the average result) returns a mean value that is within 0.001 units of the average of *every single damage roll* I have made up to that point. When I hit a value of \"n\" damage rolls that satisfies this threshold, we are reaching a spot where adding another dice roll to the simulation does not significantly change the average result, so we stop increasing the number of times we make the damage roll, and we say this is a reasonable approximation of the average result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've constructed this as a for loop nested within a while loop.  The while loop continues iterating until we meet our convergence criteria, and the for loop calculates the mean damage roll for \"n\" damage rolls. Our first experiment is going to be rolling our damage total 4 times (n = 4). Once the for loop is done, we figure out the \"average\" of those 4 damage rolls, and we append it to our running tally of average results for \"n\" damage rolls. We then increment and go to 5 damage rolls and repeat the process for n = 5, then n = 6, and so forth. We will proceed until the average of \"n\" damage rolls is roughly equal to the average of **all** of the damage rolls I've made prior to those \"n\" rolls (taking the average of 1 roll, 2 rolls, 3 rolls, etc). To set up this simulation, I seeded the results of 1, 2, and 3 dice rolls with a few values - the minimum possible result (13), the maximum possible result (63), and something about in the middle (40). I did this to make sure I start out my 4 roll simulation in a spot where I am not immediately meeting my threshold criteria so that the simulation can proceed. As n gets large, the value of these first 3 made up results become insignificant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start - this is a great test case for a monte-carlo type method because we know the result or can figure it out easily based on probability.  Without going into too many details, the mean result for a d12 is 6.5, and the mean result for a d4 is 2.5. Based on that (4\\*6.5) + 5 + (2\\*2.5) + 2 = 38\n",
    "\n",
    "If we've done our simulation correctly, we expect that our mean result will converge on 38.  Again, I am pointing this out because a computer will give you an output even if you've made mistakes in your code.  Anytime you can, test out your method on a system that you know the answer to - get it working there, and then scale it up to the system that you don't know the answer to already.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ultimately, this script will print out the number of rolls it takes to get within 0.001 absolute error from the running mean; plot the average damage roll as a function of dice rolls made; and print out the tolerance returned at your last step. You should see that as you increase the number of dice you roll, your mean result approach the true mean.\n",
