    "## General Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are designing chemical reactors, we have to consider two key questions about the reactions occuring in them: **how far** does the reaction go and **how fast** does the reaction get there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is important from the perspective of raw material cost and process complexity. All chemical reactions have a maximum extent that they can reach (a maximum fractional conversion). This dictates how much reactant we convert per pass in a reactor, and it at least partially determines how much unconverted species we will have to either lose or recycle, both of which increase expenses. It is important to remember that the maximum conversion that a reaction can attain is not always 1. If a reaction is ***thermodynamically unfavorable***, it may only have a maximum conversion of a few percent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second question (how fast?) is important because it affects the size of chemical reactors and/or how long we need to allow for the reaction to occur.  In general, the slower the process, the longer it takes, the larger the reactor it requires, and/or the more expensive it will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "We answer the first question (**how far**) by considering the thermodynamics of a reaction.  Specifically, we consider the changes in the state functions of enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy that occur when ***reactants are converted into products***.  We answer the second question (**how fast**) by considering the kinetics of the reaction. Specificaly, we consider the changes in the state functions of enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy that occur when ***reactants are converted into transition states***.  Consider the energy diagram for a generic, thermodynamically favorable reaction $R \\leftrightarrow P$:\n",

    "In the energy diagram above, the Gibbs free energy of reaction ($\\Delta G_{\\textrm{rxn}}$) addresses the question of how far a reaction will go at a given temperature, pressure, and starting composition. It quantifies the change in Gibbs free energy when reactants are converted into products. The Gibbs free energy of activation ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$) addresses the question of how fast a reaction will occur at a given temperature, pressure, and composition.  Note that there are activation barriers for both the forward reaction ($\\Delta G_f^{\\ddagger}$) and the reverse reaction ($\\Delta G_r^{\\ddagger}$). The Gibbs free energy of activation for the forward reaction ($\\Delta G_f^{\\ddagger}$) describes the change in Gibbs free energy that occurs when reactants are converted into the transition state, and the Gibbs free energy of activation for the reverse reaction ($\\Delta G_r^{\\ddagger}$) quantifies the change in Gibbs free energy that occurs when products are converted into the transition state.The difference between these two barriers ***must*** equal the energy change of reaction ($\\Delta G_{\\textrm{rxn}}$), so only two of the three quantities can be independently specified:\n",

    "Let's say we fill a batch reactor of volume $V$ with $N_{A0}$ moles of species A and $N_{B0}$ moles of species B, and we let the system react for an infinite amount of time.  *Eventually* this system will reach chemical equilibrium.  We generally know that the composition of the system can be described in terms of an equilibrium constant, even if we don't quite remember what that equilibrium constant means, how it is calculated, or how we relate it to composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost any time I ask a student to define the equilibrium constant for this reaction, this is the answer I will get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K = \\frac{C_B}{C_A^2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's consider whether those two equilibrium constants are actually the same thing...which we seem to have naively concluded above. Note that concentration has units of quantity per volume; for example: moles per liter (Molarity). Because of this, we can see that our first definition of K has to have units of inverse concentration, for example (L mol$^{-1})$.  In contrast, if we inspect the second equation, we see that:\n",

    "A reaction is at **Chemical Equilibrium** when the Gibbs free energy of the reacting system is *at a minimum* with respect to changes in the number of moles of each species (composition) at a fixed Temperature and Pressure.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$G = f(T, P, N_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in determining the minimum in Gibbs energy for our system.  Finding a minimum is usually accomplished by taking a derivative.  Gibbs free energy is a function of the canonical variables $(T, P, N_j).$ So if we were to take the total derivative of Gibbs free energy, it looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dG = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}dT + \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P}dP + \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_j}dn_j$$\n",

    "The three partial derivatives all define very specific Thermodynamic variables:\n",

    "    \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T} &= -S \\\\\n",

    "    \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_j} &= \\mu_j \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "With those definitions, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dG = -S dT + V dP + \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\mu_j dN_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll make some simplifications and substitutions.  First, we remember that we consider chemical equilbrium at a constant temperature and pressure.  For that reason, if we are at chemical equilibrium, T and P are constant, and so dT and dP are both zero.  This simplifies the relevant derivative to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dG = \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\mu_j dN_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we recall from **Lecture 02** that, for a single reaction, we can define the number of moles of any species ($N_j$) in the reactor as a function of the extent of reaction.  Specifically, we define the extent of reaction as:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$dG = \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\mu_j d(N_{j,0} + \\nu_j \\varepsilon)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we consider the sum, let's examine that derivative and simplify some:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d(N_{j,0} + \\nu_j \\varepsilon) = dN_{j,0} + d(\\nu_j \\varepsilon)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term on the right hand size is zero because $N_{j,0}$ is constant as a function of the extent of reaction, so its derivative is zero.  Stoichiometric coefficients are also constant, so the derivative becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d(N_{j,0} + \\nu_j \\varepsilon) = \\nu_j d\\varepsilon$$\n",

    "We can substitute this into our expression for $dG$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dG = \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\nu_j\\mu_j d \\varepsilon$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dG}{d\\varepsilon} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\nu_j\\mu_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a bit more strict, we'll use the following notation, which indicates that we are specifically taking the derivative of Gibbs free energy with respect to reaction extent, $\\varepsilon$, at a constant Temperature and Pressure, which is in line with our usual analysis of a system at chemical equilibrium:\n",

    "$$\\left(\\frac{dG}{d\\varepsilon}\\right)_{T,P} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\nu_j\\mu_j$$\n",

It is defined in terms of species chemical potentials on the right hand side.  We know that, at chemical equilibrium, Gibbs free energy is at a minimum with respect to reaction extent, so the derivative above has to be equal to zero at chemical equilibrium.  Thus, we can conclude that:\n",

Probably the most important thing to remember about this definition is that activity is a ***relative*** quantity.  It depends on both the actual state of the system and the reference state of the system. For the types of problems we'll address, the reference state for species $j$ should always be the same in the definition of the reference state chemical potential, $\\mu_j^\\circ$, as it is in the reference state fugacity $f_j^\\circ$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It actually isn't helpful to switch to working with fugacities just yet, so we'll stick with activities for now.  Let's substitute our definition for chemical potential into the derivative of Gibbs, $\\frac{dG}{d\\varepsilon}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\nu_j\\mu_j = \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S} \\nu_j \\mu_j^\\circ + \\sum_{j = 1}^{N_S}\\nu_jRT\\ln{\\left(a_j\\right)}$$\n",

    "We may not recognize it in this form, but \"Partial Molar Gibbs Free Energy\" ($G_j$) is another name for chemical potential.  With that in mind, we simplify the first term in the summation, which represents the standard state free energy of reaction:\n",
