    "# Reactors with Recycle\n",
    "\n",
    "During L26, we considered the idea that a reactor-with-recycle process could be used to attain high overall (process-level) conversion for reactions that are somehow limited to low single pass (once through the reactor) conversion.  The scenario we considered in class was an equilibrium-limited reaction (propane dehydrogenation), but reactor-with-recycle schemes can also be used to improve overall yields when dealing with sequential reactions.  Specifically, it allows one to operate the reactor at relatively low single-pass conversion to avoid secondary reactions, but it recycles the remainder to allow a high overall conversion."

    "We still have a degree of freedom in this system, so we can't solve it just yet.  But, once we specify the recycle ratio, we can fully solve for all flowrates and the single pass conversion through the PFR. The way I'm approaching the analysis here is that we know the equilibrium limit on this PFR at 500K and 8.2 atm is ~ 44% conversion, so we just have to find a recycle ratio that will allow us to operate with a PFR below 44% conversion."

    "### This was an easy problem...\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is probably the simplest possible scenario that we can consider in that we are given the overall process level conversion (0.95) and allowed to vary the recycle ratio until we find the point where the single pass reactor level conversion is within the equilibrium limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is straightforward for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because we have a specification on the overall conversion of the process (95%), it is straightforward to calculate $F_{A3}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    F_{A_3} = F_{Af}(1 - X_{A_{ov}})\\\\\n",
    "    F_{A_3} = 0.5 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{min}^{-1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Since we were given the freedom to adjust the recycle ratio to reduce the necessary single pass conversion, we can set the recycle ratio to a value--here we found that $\\alpha = 0.96$ will permit the PFR to operate at a conversion that is less than the equilibrium limit.  Once $\\alpha$ is specified, the balance on the splitter to gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    F_{A2} &= \\frac{F_{A3}}{1 - \\alpha} \\\\\n",
    "    F_{AR} &= \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} F_{A3} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $F_{A3}$ and $\\alpha$ are known here, we can solve to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    F_{A_2} = 12.5 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{min}^{-1}\\\\\n",
    "    F_{A_R} = 12.0 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{min}^{-1}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A balance on the separator then tells us that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{A1} = F_{A2} = 12.5 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{min}^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A balance on the mixer gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{A0} = F_{AF} + F_{AR} = 22.0 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{min}^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Since we know the flowrate of propane coming into and out of the reactor, we can calculate the single pass conversion in the reactor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{A_sp} = 0.432$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, basically, with those specifications, we can easily figure out the molar flowrate of A at every point in the PFD, and we can easily size a PFR that operates at 8.2 atm and 500K with an inlet propane flowrate of 22 moles per minute to accomplish 43.2% conversion.\n",

The entire process is carried out at T = 573K and P = 1.0 atm.  If the volume of the CSTR is 400L, and we recycle 50% of the unreacted species A, calculate the single pass and overall conversion of A achieved in this process.\n",
