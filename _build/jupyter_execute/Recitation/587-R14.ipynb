In the Python solution, we'll use lambda functions to construct the $C_{p,j}(T)$ expressions and then use those functions in a second set of lambda function definitions to specifiy $\\Delta C_{p,i}$ for each reaction.  Once we do that, we can integrate the expressions from the reference temperature $T_0 = 298 \\ K$ to the as yet unknown reaction temperature using Gaussian Quadrature.\n",

    "At this point, we've specified every equation in terms of constants and our unknowns: $F_A$, $F_B$, $F_C$, $F_D$, $F_E$, and $T$. The problem can be solved with `opt.root()`."
