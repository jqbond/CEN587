    "# The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercises are intended to build familiarity and confidence with Python basics. We will start by learning about, creating, and manipulating various data types and data structures.  This module also covers basic operations with indexing and slicing using strings; these techniques will extend to lists and arrays in subsequent modules.\n",

    "```{admonition} Running in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "If you are running this module in a Jupyter Notebook instead of viewing it in a web browser, you can run a cell by pressing the \"Run\" button in the menu bar above. Alternatively, my preference is to press Ctrl-Enter to run the cell.\n",

    "## Scalars vs. Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports various Data Types and Data Structures. The first two modules demonstrate the differences between each of these and how and when we might use them. It is first important to understand the difference between a **scalar** and a **collection**. In simple terms, a *scalar* refers to a something that has one and only one value associated with it, whereas a *collection* refers to a set that contains multiple items. If you are familiar with the ideas of a \"row\", \"column\", \"vector\", \"matrix\", or \"array\" from working in a language like Matlab, these are examples of collections, each of which can be created in Python. Python also uses other types of collections called *lists*, *tuples*, *dictionaries*, and *sets*.  Generally, these types of collections are called **data structures**. We will discuss them in Notebook 02, but first we need to understand scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these as variables that have a single value. Although your mind probably immediately jumps to a single number as an example of a scalar (which it is), scalars in Python are not necessarily numbers. In Python, there are many types (classes) of scalars that we will need to be familiar with:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "* **int** refers to an \"integer,\" which is a whole number. **Examples:** 1, 7, 452\n",
    "* **float** refers to a floating point decimal approximation of a number. Python defaults to 64-bit double-precision values  for floats. The maximum value any floating-point number in Python is about 1.8 x 10<sup>308</sup>. Anything larger than this will return as *inf*  **Examples:** 2.0, 6.75, 100.3\n",
    "* **complex** refers to a number that has an imaginary part. **Example:** 4.2 + 6i. Note that in Python, a \"j\" is used instead of an \"i\" for imaginary numbers.\n",
    "* **bool** A logical Boolean value. It is binary - either True or False. In most languages, including Python, True = 1, False = 0 or []. Python also recognizes explicit declarations of True and False\n",
    "* **str** A \"string\" of characters.  These are declared in Python using single, double, or triple quotes. For the purposes of this demonstration, they are interchangeable, but know that single, double, and triple quotes may have different applications when writing strings.  **Examples** 'Dog.', \"Cat.\", \"Doggo?\", '''Not a Doggo!''' are all strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a scalar\n",

Multiplication between a string an a floating point number is not permissible because it is unclear what, e.g., 0.75\\*'dog' *is* exactly, whereas we can provide a logical output for 3*'dog'. Print the results for the operations below and consider why they behave as they do.  This is an example of type specificity in Python.  Frequently, we will encounter errors that arise from our trying to use a floating point decimal where Python is expecting an integer (or vice versa), or perhaps trying to perform an operation on string that has no logical interpretation.  This provides an early illustration of why it is important to understand that there are different types of scalars and how to get information on the class of a scalar."
