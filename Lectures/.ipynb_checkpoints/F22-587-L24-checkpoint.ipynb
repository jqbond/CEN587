This problem is a bit unique in that we can solve balances for A, B, and C sequentially.  This is enabled by the fact that the balance on A is independent of species B; solving the balance on A enables us to solve the balance on B; the balance on B is independent of species C; and solving the balance on B enables us to solve the balance on C.

    "#### Optimizing Yields and Selectivities\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have the classic problem in maximizing selectivity/yield to the intermediate species in a sequence of reactions.  Selectivity is maximizing by operating as close to zero conversion as possible.  This is because, in this limit, the concentration of species C is near zero, so the rate of the second reaction is near zero.  Unfortunately, since yield is the product of conversion and selectivity, the yield of C also approaches zero at zero conversion.  To produce a viable quantity of product C, you'll have to tolerate some loss of selectivity -- The point of maximum yield will be the mass of catalyst where conversion has increased enough to produce an appreciable quantity of C, but not so much that we are producing mostly D.  As shown below, this occurs at 140 kg of catalyst, where we find a maximum yield of B of approximately 40%."
