    "## Numerical Methods\n",

    "The majority of our prior courses in algebra, calculus, physics, chemistry, and engineering present us with problems that are difficult to formulate but straightforward to solve.  What I mean is that we may struggle to develop the model equation that describes our system, but once we have that equation, it is usually easy for us to solve. Often, we are even able to solve that equation ***analytically***. What do we mean by solving a problem analytically?  This is when we are able to use methods from algebra, trigonometry, calculus, etc. to \"solve for x\", i.e., to obtain a closed form solution that explicitly states the value of my variable of interest. Some examples to clarify that point.  The following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = x^2 - 25$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be solved ***analytically*** by factoring or by simply moving 25 to the left hand side of the equation and taking the square root, giving:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 5 \\ \\textrm{or} \\ x = -5$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "If not that, we could use a quadratic equation to get an explicit solution for x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example from calculus:  Let's say I want to compute the area under the curve given by $y = 3x^3$ from x = 0 to x = 10.  It is straightforward to evaluate that definite integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{Area} = \\int_0^{10}(3 x^3 dx) = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot x^4 \\big|_0^{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is evaluated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{Area} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 10^4\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 0^4\\right) = 7500$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us are comfortable with these types of analytical solutions because it is what we've been trained to do. As we begin to deal with more advanced topics, we often need to solve problems where it may be tedious, difficult, or even impossible to find an analytical solution. This is where ***numerical solutions*** come in.  Generally speaking, numerical methods are algorithms that employ simple operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to provide approximate solutions to problems that do not have tractable analytical solutions. The basic operations at the core of numerical methods (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are repeated iteratively, often many, many times, until we obtain a solution that is within our precision tolerance for a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The iterative nature of numerical methods makes them very tedious on paper but extremely efficient in most programming languages.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first encounter numerical methods, many of us are uncomfortable with them because they look so different from the analytical solutions that have been ingrained in our minds as the way we will solve problems.  But fear not!  Most of them are conceputally very simple! Further, their are packages available in Python that automate most numerical methods for us, so once we get the hang of syntax, they are very, very easy to use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will see what is under the hood with numerical methods for a couple of test problems to get a feel for how they work, and then we'll introduce some packages available in Python that handle numerical solutions for us in a very efficient and robust way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises on general Numerical Methods are covered in Supplements 09 - 14. They address four broad classes of problems that are essential for engineers to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Root finding -- Supplements 09 and 12\n",
    "2. Optimization (finding minima and maxima) -- Supplements 10 and 11\n",
    "3. Solving differential equations (initial value problems) Supplement 14\n",
    "4. Numerical Quadrature (integrating a univariate function or discrete data set) Supplement 14\n",
    "\n",
    "To build confidence when trying to learn a new method for problem solving, I advocate testing it out on a problem that we already know how to solve to make sure we get the correct answer. Once you master that, then apply the methods to increasingly complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final note about why you should embrace numerical methods:  Once you *get* them, they are really easy - often times they are *much* easier than developing an analytical solution.  You can write a code to handle them, and then reuse that code over and over and over by adapting it to suit the problem at hand.  They will greatly expand your ability to solve problems, and I guarantee that you will be able to use them in the rest of your engineering curricula."

    "## Root Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the most straightforward case first - using numerical methods to find the root of a function. All we mean by root finding is that we are finding the value of the function argument(s) where the function is equal to zero.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Root Finding for Univariate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the case of root finding with a ***univariate function***, which basically means ***a function that only has one independent variable***. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(x) = x^2 + exp(x) - 7x + 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is only a function of x.  Once I specify a value of x, I can evaluate the corresponding value of y.  y is thus a univariate function of x. We actually introduced a test univariate function in Supplement 06 (While Loops), and we used a simple numerical method to solve it, so let's pick up that example, use it again here, and expand our toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The basic problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a *univariate* function, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(x) = 5x^2 + 8x - 23$$ \n",

    "We would like to find the **roots** for that function. By that, we mean the values of x where y = 0. So, when we discuss \"root finding\" for this equation, we are simply solving the equation below for x:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = 5x^2 + 8x - 23$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important thing to remember as we move forward. The equations that we see and develop in our models will take many different forms, but when we write programs that use numerical methods to solve them, for a univariate function, we will always be solving 0 = f(x), and so we will have to write our code accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Utility of Graphing your Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime I can do so (and I can typically do so with univariate functions), I will graph the function of interest on various domains (ranges of x values) so that I can see where roots might be located. As we consider the use of numerical methods, we will see how important it is to provide good initial guesses for the root or a reasonable range of x-values where we think we are likely to find the root. So if it is possible, start by graphing the function of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't talked much about graphing functions. It seems straightforward until you go to do it in base Python, and then you might scratch your head a bit as to how you'd actually use a function to generate a large set of y values from a large set of x values. So let's cover a bit of syntax using lists (which we are familiar with), and then cover some of the utility of numpy arrays in these types of operations. \n",

We continue changing our value of x until we are close enough to y = 0 that we are satisfied with the solution. This is a very basic numerical method!\n",

You proceed with this iteration until your function value is sufficiently close to zero that you are satisfied with the solution, i.e., you are within your precision tolerance. This algorithm is *much* more efficient than the simple guess and check method we used above.  We can write a Newton-Raphson iteration to solve our example problem. Because this is a far faster and more robust method, I will set a much tighter tolerance. You will notice that it takes far fewer iterations, and it converges to much closer to the value to the true root(s).  \n",

For bracketing methods, the function value at the lower limit (f(lower)) and the function value at the upper limit f(upper) need to have opposite signs. We can easily determine this by looking at a graph. For example, we can see that x = -2, y(-2) = -19 and at x = 2, y(2) = 13...so -2 and 2 is a good range to specify for a bracketing algorithm like brentq.

I do like the universal interface of root_scalar, and I suspect it may eventually reach a point where everything but root_scalar becomes deprecated, so it is worth considering it here.
