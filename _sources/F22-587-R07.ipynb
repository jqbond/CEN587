    "We have assumed the rate of reaction depends only on the concentration of A, and that the reaction order is unspecified. We have further assumed that the fluid density is constant in this system.  With these things in mind, we can develop the rate law below, which illustrates the functional dependence of rate on $C_A$ and, by extension $X_A$.\n",

The Notebook for L20 does this using some generic functions that solve for CSTR and PFR volumes giving arguments of fractional conversion ($X_A$) and reaction order ($\\alpha$).\n",
