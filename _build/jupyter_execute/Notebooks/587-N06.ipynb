    "For a single reaction at chemical equilibrium, we know that the following must be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta G^\\circ}{RT}\\right) = K = \\prod_{j = 1}^{N_S}a_j^{\\nu_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The left hand side of the above equation is relatively straightforward for us after taking courses in Thermodynamics.  Specifically, we know that we can calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G^\\circ = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_s} \\nu_j G_j^\\circ$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can frequently look up standard state partial molar Gibbs Free Energies in thermodynamic databases.  If not, we usually can find enthalpies and entropies, and we know the general relationship between Gibbs Free Energy, Enthalpy, and Entropy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So this shouldn't be a problem for us.  The right hand side is a bit trickier.  This is where information about the composition of the system at equilibirum is contained.  To figure this out, we have to go back to the activity definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_j = \\frac{f_j}{f_j^\\circ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the fucacity in the numerator, $f_j$, is the fugacity of species $j$ at ***system conditions of temperature, pressure, and composition***, while the fugacity of species $j$ in the denominator, $f_j^\\circ$, is the fugacity of species $j$ at ***its reference state temperature, pressure, and composition.*** It is critical to remember that the standard state fugacity, $f_j^\\circ$, should describe the fugacity of species $j$ at the state used in calculating $\\Delta G^\\circ$.  In other words, just make sure that when we calculate $G_j^\\circ$ and $f_j^\\circ$ that $\\circ$ means the same thing in both cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, in this class, we'll always follow a few rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Delta G^\\circ$ is always calculated at the Temperature that the reaction is occuring.\n",
    "2. $\\Delta G^\\circ$ is always calculated at a reference Pressure of 1 bar.\n",
    "3. $\\Delta G^\\circ$ is always calculated for the phases of matter listed in our reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appropriate phase for the reference state is indicated by the (g), (l), (s), (aq.) notation in a balanced chemical reaction. If we are going to calculate the Gibbs free energy change for the following reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For species $j$ in the gas phase (g):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the reference state of species $j$ as a pure gas at 1 bar and the reaction temperature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**For species $j$ in the liquid phase (l):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the reference state of species $j$ as a pure liquid at 1 bar and the reaction temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For species $j$ in the solid phase (s):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the reference state of species $j$ as a pure solid at 1 bar and the reaction temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For species $j$ in solution, e.g., for species dissolved in water (aq.):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the reference state of species $j$ dissolved in the specified solvent at a specified composition or concentration at 1 bar and the reaction temperature. There are three commonly used conventions for species in solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Infinite dilution -- the mole fraction of $j$ approaches zero in the solvent ($x_j \\rightarrow 0$)\n",
    "2. A 1 Molar solution of $j$ in the solvent -- the concentration of $j$ in the solution is 1 mole per liter of solution.\n",
    "3. A 1 Molal solution of $j$ in the solvent -- the concentration of $j$ in solution is 1 mole $j$ per kg of solvent.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important} \n",
    "In our class, the reactions will always be given for pure species as either gases, liquids, or solids.  We will not use solution reference states in this course.\n",

    "The way that we define fugacity depends on the system.  It can change quite a bit depending on the phase of matter we are considering. We may also decide on reference states based on their convenience for one type of system compared to another, and this can impact how we define a fugacity for that phase. In this course, we will only use pure species reference states.  Either pure species as gases, as liquids, or as solids.  We'll make that decision based on the reaction we're considering and the thermodynamic data available to us.  Next we'll go through the various fugacity and activity definitions for each type of system we might consider: pure gases, pure liquids, pure solids, and also mixtures of gases, mixtures of liquids, and mixtures of solids.\n",

    "### Fugacities for Pure Gases\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from Thermodynamics that you would define the fugacity of a pure gas, $j$, at a pressure, $P$, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_j = \\phi_j P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the symbol $\\phi_j$ represents the \"fugacity coefficient\" for species $j$ at the Temperature, Pressure, and composition under consideration. It quantifies the degree of non-ideality (i.e., the amount the system departs from it's reference state). In general, the fugacity coefficient is defined in terms of the \"Residual Gibbs Free Energy\" of species $j$.  This represents the deviaton from thermodynamic ideality associated with moving the species $j$ from its reference state to the state of the system under our current consideration.  As the species moves further away from its thermodynamic reference state, one expects deviations from thermodynamically ideal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_j = \\exp{\\left(\\frac{G^R}{RT}\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't really use that definition much.  The biggest thing to remember about the fugacity coefficient is that it is really only sensitive to pressure (not temperature or composition). Gases behave ideally at low pressures, and they become nonideal at very high pressures.  When a gas is ideal, $G^R = 0$, and the fugacity coefficient, $\\phi$, is 1. Therefore, at low pressures, the fugacity of a pure gas, $f_j$, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_j \\approx P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At high pressures, the Residual Gibbs Free Energy can be greater or less than equal to zero, so, at high pressures $\\phi \\neq 1$. Therefore, at high pressures, we have to use the following definition for the fugacity of a pure gas $f_j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_j = \\phi_j P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activities for pure gases\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above definitions of fugacity in mind, we can now define thermodynamic activities for pure gases, $a_j$ in terms of the species fugacity at system conditions ($f_j$) and the species fugacity at its reference state ($f_j^\\circ$).  Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_j = \\frac{f_j}{f_j^\\circ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're working with pure gases, we will use the above described fugacity definitions, and then we will simplify according to our knowledge about the various states we are considering:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_j = \\frac{\\phi_j P}{{(\\phi_j P)}^\\circ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a thermodynamic activity is defined by the ratio of the fugacity of the species as it exists in the real, reacting system at its Temperature, Pressure, and Composition $(T, P, \n",
    "x_j)$ to the fugacity of that species in its reference state.  The quantity in the numerator of the activity definition refers to the ***system*** conditions, which may be very high pressure. Until we know the pressure in the system, we have to keep the fugacity coefficient in our equation.  The reference state for a pure gas, however, is a pure gas at 1 bar.  Since that is a low pressure, we know the fugacity coefficient of species $j$, $\\phi_j$, in the reference state is 1, and we get the following definition for the activity of a pure gas, $a_j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_j = \\frac{\\phi_j P}{P^\\circ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we are tempted to think that $P^\\circ$ has a numerical value of 1, this is only true if we are working in pressure units of bars. It is useful for us to keep it in the definition since it reminds us to include units and convert the system or reference pressures as needed to cancel units and give a dimensionless activity. At low pressures only, this Equation simplifies to $a_j = P/P^\\circ$."

We'll use this when we define thermodynamic activities. For a gas in a mixture, we define the fugacity of species $j$, $\\hat{f}_j$, according to the Lewis-Randall rule, which says that the fugacity of a species in a mixture is given by the product of the mole fraction of that species and it's pure species fugacity at the same conditions; therefore, for gases in a mixture:\n",

Focusing on the denominator, the same things apply.  The reference pressure of 1 bar is not going to be much different from the saturation pressure, and we have a small molar volume, so the Poynting correction is also 1 in the reference state, as is the saturation pressure fugacity coefficient, $\\phi_j^\\textrm{sat}$.
