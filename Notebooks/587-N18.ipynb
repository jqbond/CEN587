Again, there is considerable flexibility in how we reduce the number of state dependent variables and relate them to each other. Here we will chose to make the one state dependent variable fractional conversion, and we will express all other quantities in terms of fractional conversion.

    "The steps we have taken above aren't hard, but they are tedious, and it is easy to make mistakes when applying this approach.  The good part about this is that it allows us to solve the problem analytically.  We then are able to derive a function that tells us exactly what volume is required for a certain conversion.  There is no numerical instability to worry about here.  In general, we can follow this type of approach anytime we have an (isothermal) Batch Reactor or a (isothermal, isobaric) Tubular Reactor where there is only one reaction occuring.  We can always relate all properties of the system back to fractional conversion in those cases.  But sometimes, it really isn't worth it.  In the next lecture, we'll see that this approach quickly hits its limit, even for simple problems, when we add a little bit of complexity. In these cases, even the simplified differential equation is messy, and an easy analytical solution is not forthcoming.  We'll go through it just to illustrate where we hit a wall, what we have to do to get around it, and then we'll consider a better approach for complex problems."
