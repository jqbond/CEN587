    "# Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, particularly with data analysis, it is often either necessary or just ***really, really useful*** for us to work with collections of \"things\" instead of single, scalar values. You are probably familiar with this concept from your introductions to Matlab, which uses specific types of collections called arrays and matrices. Python includes support for both arrays and matrices in addition to several other types of collections that we might be less familiar with. As with scalars, each type of collection has unique properties that determine how we interact with them at the Python console and the applications they can or should be used for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of collections comprise the various **data structures** that we can use in Python. In Engineering courses, probably the ones that we will encounter most are probably **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **numpy arrays**. It is important to understand that the first three data structures given here (lists, tuples, and dictionaries) are part of base Python; however, these aren't necessarily the most convenient data structures for performing mathematical operations. In engineering courses, we're generally going to be happiest working with numpy arrays as they have a lot of the behavior we may come to expect in math programming languages based on experience with, e.g., Matlab. That said, numpy arrays are not a default data structure in Python -- numpy arrays are accessible only after we add support for them, and they are mostly used in numerical and scientific packages (e.g., numpy, scipy), which we have to specifically add to enrich the features of base Python. Almost certainly, we will sometimes need to work with other types of data strucyures, so it is important to know taht these all exist, what their different properties are, and how you would create them in Python."

    "Lists are a versatile type of collection. They are the main workhorse data structure in base Python, and they are frequently the default data structure if you don't explicitly format things as a numpy array (numpy arrays will be addressed later). so you'll probably have to work with them at some point. **Note:** the terminology \"base Python\" used here means that lists are \"built in\" to the Python base. To use arrays, we generally add a package (numpy), so numpy arrays are not part of \"base Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an indexed, **mutable** set of \"items\" that are ordered, i.e., each entry has a unique index. The \"items\" in a list can include any type of scalar or any type of collection and there are really few restrictions on what can be stored in a list structure. Because lists are **mutable**, we can we can change their contents after they are created. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, G is a list of integers; H is a list of strings; and I is a list of lists, each of which is a list of floating point numbers. Notice that, when creating the multi-level list I, the top level list is defined with a pair of brackets, and each list inside of that list is also defined with a pair of brackets.  This is a universal syntax in Python for defining multi-level lists and tuples, and it extends to creating N-dimensional arrays, which we use to create matrices."

You store key:value pairs when you create a dictionary, and when you need to recall a specific value, you do so by passing the key associated with that value into the dictionary name.  For example, lets say you have a dictionary containing the core members of the Grateful Dead in 1977 sorted by their roles in the band.  You can create a dictionary in two ways; the first is using curly braces {}. You just add key:value pairs as a comma-separated series inside of the braces, and that gives you a dictionary.  Generally, you have flexibility as to what can be a key and what can be a value.

Generaly speaking, arrays are **mutable**, ordered collections in which each element has a specific index. They can include any type of scalar or collection, so they are superficially similar to lists, but they have some important differences. One of the major ones, in simple terms is that you can *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on an array, whereas you cannot *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on a list (this is addressed in more detail in Module 03). \n",

If you are familiar with Matlab, the \"array\" class in Python behaves similarly to the vectors and matrices that you're used to working with in Matlab (whereas lists, tuples, and dictionaries do not).

    "## A significant difference between a list and a numpy array\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and numpy arrays look similar, and they share a lot of similar properties.  One important difference between the two is that lists and numpy arrays behave very differently when we try to do math on them.  A numpy array will behave similarly to what you would think of as a row, column, vector, matrix, etc. in Matlab.  A list will not; it interacts with math operators differently than you might expect if you're coming from a Matlab background.  Generally speaking, the default behavior of a list is that it will interpret a math operation as a concatenation, whereas an array will execute that math operation on each element of the array. Many times, there is no logical way to interpret a math operation as a concatenation, so math on lists will throw an error. This will come up in more detail in later Modules, but a reasonable example is the following; we create a list and a numpy array that are superficially identical:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "print(O + O)\n",
