In that case, the only option left for me is to solve this numerically. If we think about this problem some, we are looking for the reactor volume required to achieve a fractional conversion of 0.85.  If we restructure the above equation a little, we'll see that the volume is just given by a definite integral, which we can solve on a calculator or with quadrature in Python.\n",

    "While it is generally a good idea to get an analytical solution if we can, we have to recognize that when problems start to get more complex, we invariably have to solve them using a computer with some type of numerical method.  If we're going to use a computer anyway (as above), my advice is to really lean into using the computer. Usually, I prefer not to spend a lot of time and effort deriving a complicated equation like the final ODE above.  I don't like doing that because it is tedious and, inevitably, I make mistakes and have trouble figuring out where I made them because the final equations are incomprehenisble in terms of physical significance of the terms in them.\n",

Instead of expressing $F_A$, $F_B$, and $F_C$ in terms of fractional conversion of B, we just write material balances of A, B, and C if we find we need to know how A, B, and C change as a function of time, reactor volume, etc. So, for this problem, we would start out as usual by writing a balance on B (see first part of solution above):\n",

    "### Solution to Example Problem 02\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a balance on Species A in a well-mixed batch reactor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = R_AV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We define $R_A$ as usual:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_A = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N_R} \\nu_{i,A} \\, r_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We again have a single reaction, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_A = -r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement tells us that the reaction is first order in A and first order in B, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = kC_AC_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_A = -kC_AC_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We substitute this into the material balance to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = -kC_AC_BV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We encounter the usual situation where we have a single ODE in 1 independent variable (time) and 3 dependent variables (NA, CA, CB).  We *can* use the approaches from lecture 14 and 15 to obtain a hand solution for this problem. That is, we can express NA, CA, and CB all as functions of fractional conversion.  But I am going to choose to solve it by writing balances on any species I need to keep track of.  Here, we only need to keep track of A and B.  Volume is constant, so the concentrations of species only depend on the number of moles of A and B in the system at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach in mind, we write balances on A and B:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\frac{dN_A}{dt} = R_AV \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{dN_B}{dt} = R_BV \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I just make sure I define everything on the right hand side of those balance equations in terms of NA, NB, and/or t.  If I can do that, I can solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the production rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    R_A = -r \\\\\n",
    "    R_B = -r \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = kC_AC_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the concentrations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    C_A = N_A/V \\\\\n",
    "    C_B = N_B/V \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, volume is constant at 17L, so we have basically solved the problem.  All we need to do is write up these equations as a function that we can integrate with solve_ivp."
