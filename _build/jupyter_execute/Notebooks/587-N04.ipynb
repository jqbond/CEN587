    "\n",
    "We will define a quantity called the ***extent of reaction***.  Here we'll use a pretty loose definition and just say that the extent of reaction is a measure of how \"much\" reaction has occurred. For convenience (and compatibility with stoichiometric coefficients), we will define the extent of reaction in molar units, i.e., how many moles of reaction have occured. An important thing to understand about the extent of reaction is that it is something that is specific to a ***reaction, $i$***, it is not something that is specific to a ***species, $j$***. Therefore, we will define the extent of reaction for a specific reaction, $i$. We use the symbol $\\varepsilon_i$ to represent the extent of the $i^{th}$ reaction.  \n",

    "$$\\varepsilon_i = \\textrm{moles of reaction $i$ that have occured}$$\n",

    "If that is a bit too abstract, just consider that we often have many reactions to consider in a reacting systems.  Each reaction gets its own extent.  The index $i$ corresponds to the number you've assigned that reaction in your network. Now, let's consider a single reaction with generic species ($A$, $B$, and $C$) and stoichiometric coefficients ($\\nu_A$, $\\nu_B$, and $\\nu_C$):\n",

    "We perform this reaction in a batch reactor that we initially charge with the following quantities of each species: $N_{A_0}$, $N_{B_0}$, and $N_{C_0}$.  We would like to describe how the quantity of each of those species changes as the reaction occurs; we can do so using the extent of reaction. For this particular example, this is the only reaction occuring, so we assign it the number 1.  We can then assign a specific extent for that reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\varepsilon_1 = \\textrm{moles of reaction $1$ that have occured}$$\n",

To do this, we only need to recognize that every time this reaction occurs, it will:\n",

Perhaps a more useful way to think of this is that each molar quantity is now a ***function*** of a single extent of reaction, $f(\\varepsilon_1)$. Basically, this reduces the number of unknowns we need to deal with, and we will use this extensively in solving algebraic equations, primarily equilibrium problems and CSTR sizing equations. From the above, we can conclude that, ***for a single reaction***, we can define the reaction extent in terms of the change in molar quantity of any species as long as we normalize that change by the stoichiometric coefficient for that species.\n",

    "Either may be useful to us.  We already saw that we were able to use reaction extents to define the molar quantity of each species in terms of a single variable that measures reaction progress (the extent).  ***For a single reaction only***, we can do a similar thing with fractional conversion.  This is a frequent approach in reactor design.  It is attractive for a few reasons, chief among them is that ***fractional conversion is an intensive quantity*** that is independent of system size. Further, ***fractional conversion is always positive***. Even more specifically, if we define it in terms of the quantity of limiting reactant consumed,  ***fractional conversion must always be between 0 and 1***. For these reasons, fractional conversion is often a more practical and intuitive metric of reaction progress than the extent of reaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a tangible example, consider the question of whether 150 moles of extent is a significant amount of reaction progress or not.  It is hard to say--it depends on the size of our system.  If we started with 170 moles of A, then yes, 150 moles of reaction extent is significant. If instead, we started with several million moles of A, then no 150 moles of reaction extent is not significant. In contrast, stating that our system achieves a fractional conversion of 0.882 (150/170) is unambiguous and independent of scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, you tend to encounter fractional conversion more frequently than reaction extent in discussion of reactor design problems. It is therefore often useful for us to use fractional conversion of a specific reactant to quantify the change in moles of each species.  This is slightly more complicated than using extents directly, but eventually it becomes second nature. We'll demonstrate it first for our generic reaction and then translate to a couple of specific examples. \n",

    "```{important}\n",
    "Extent of reaction, $\\varepsilon_i$ is an extensive (scale dependent) description of a reaction's progress. The magnitude and sign of extent of reaction depend on the system under consideration. Fractional conversion is an intensive (scale independent) description of species consumption. It is always positive. It is perhaps most useful for us to think about the fractional conversion of the limiting reactant, which is always between 0 and 1.\n",
