    "We write this system as an objective function below.  Again, notice that every single definition in this objective function is either a value that is constant (e.g., saturation pressures), or it is a function of our unknowns.  With that in mind, this is 7 constraint equations, 7 unknowns, and we can solve it with `scipy.opimize.root()`. We'll just modify the objective function from about to expand the number of unknowns and constraint equations."
