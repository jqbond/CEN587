We want to also determine the composition of the vapor phase.  We know that the system is at full equilibrium (chemical equilibrium *and* phase equilibrium).\n",

Here we have a vapor phase containing all three species, one liquid phase containing A and C, and second liquid phase containing only B.  So we write three phase equilibrium constraints, one for each species. \n",
