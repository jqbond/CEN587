    "# While Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Module 04 focuses mostly on **for loops**, so we should have a good feel for how they work. The main feature of a for loop is that it will iterate over all of the elements in a pre-defined set or range. A **while loop** is fundamentally different from a for loop in that it continues to loop through iterations as long as the criteria specified in the conditional statement at the start of the while loop remains true. This opens up some new possibilities in how we use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into while loop-specific action, a good way to highlight the difference between a for loop and a while loop is to use them to do the exact same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remember how for loops work?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a for loop to print all of the integers from 1 to 11 (without first creating that list of integers manually).  We will not store those integers in a list, we will just print their values to indicate passes through the for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1,12):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```"

    "## Try to do the same thing with a while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the same with a while loop. We will initiate the while loop by defining n as the first integer we are interested in printing (1) and then increment the value of n until I reach an integer value of 11: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n = 1\n",
    "while n < 12:\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "    n = n + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a for loop, a while loop starts with a keyword, **while** in this case. After the keyword, we have to specify what criteria we want to use to make a decision about the range that we iterate over.  In this case, I want to continue iterations until I reach the integer 11. While statements are a type of conditional statement (**Module 05**); they tell the program to execute the commands inside of the loop as long as certain criteria are met. In general, we set these criteria using statements involving comparison operators: greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (==), greater than or equal to (>=), less than or equal to (<=), and not equal to (!=). Optionally, they may be combined with logical operators (and, or, not) if we need to satisfy multiple criteria to continue executing the while loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I've chosen to run iterations as long as n < 12. After the condition(s) for the while loop to continue is defined, we terminate the first line with a colon, just as we would with a function or a for loop. Subsequent lines are then indented to indicate that they are inside of the while loop. Once you return to flush left, the code is outside of the while loop and will not be exectued until the while loop is completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we initialize the loop by defining n = 1. At the start, n = 1, so when the interpreter hits the comparison in the while statement, it finds that the criteria that n < 12 is true. It then continues into the while loop and executes the commands in the body of the loop. The value of n (1) is printed to the screen, and then we add 1 to the value of n and return to the start of the loop. Now n = 2, which is still less than 12, so things continue and repeat in the same way until it gets to n = 11.  Since 11 < 12, it makes another pass through the loop, prints 11 to the screen, and then updates the value of n one last time.  Here, it calculates that n = 12, so n < 12 is no longer satisfied, and the loop does not proceed through the next iteration. \n",

    "## Increment operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, some useful Python shorthand. **For loops** always iterate automatically over the range we specify at the start, so we don't control the value of the iterator once we have defined the set to iterate over. With a **while loop**, we generally update the value the quantity used to establish the while loop criteria on each pass. In the above example, we wanted to add 1 to our counter on every pass, and I include that in the loop by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n = n + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "It looks strange to define n as an implicit function of itself, but in a programming language, this syntax evaluates the right hand side using the current value of n, and then it over-writes the current value of n with whatever the right hand side evaluates to. For example, in our first pass through the above loop, n = 1. Then we hit the increment step, and we say n = n + 1, which is evaluated as n = 1 + 1, so n is redefined as 2 at the end of the first pass. At the end of the second pass, when we hit the increment, the current state is n = 2, so we evaluate n = 2 + 1, and n is redefined as 3.  This continues until our counter reaches whatever threshold we specify.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i *= i\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "To update the current value of i by multiplying it by itself, i.e., you square i (though you may not want to start this one out with i = 1. If you do, you'll get stuck in the loop because 1*1 is always 1, and you'll never reach 12).\n",
    "    \n",
    "The link below includes a number of these operations. They can be generally extended to whatever math operation you have in mind.  This is extremely common syntax in programming, so it is worth becoming familiar with the notation now. **Note**: We will most likely not use bitwise operators, at least not as they are presented here.\n",

    "Both loops give you the same result, they just have different architectures, which makes them suited to different tasks. For example, if I measured 100 discrete data points, and I wanted to perform operations on all of them, then a for loop makes sense because I'm working with an existing set. If, on the other hand, I have an application that requires me to repeat an iteration until I cross some specific threshold, then I would choose a while loop. While loops really shine when I don't have a great idea about how many iterations my loop will take, I just know that I have a conditions that needs to remain true or I have some idea of what the endpoint needs to be.

This is our tolerance on the solution. Since we are using a very crude approach, we will set a loose tolerance and say that we will be satified if we can find the value of x where y is between -0.1 and 0.1. A simple way to do this is with the `abs()` function in Python, which returns the absolute value of a number.  We can set this tolerance by saying we want to continue looking for the solution as long as `abs(y) > 0.1`. For our purposes, we'll call that \"close enough\" to zero that we've found a solution.

    "## Example 02: Steady state suffering\n",
    "\n",
    "As engineers, we are frequently interested in processes that are operating at steady state.  This means that conditions for that process - temperatures, concentrations, pressures, etc. - are not changing as a function of time. But it is unusual for a process to *start* at steady state.  Let's look at how long it takes for your body to reach steady state on a run!\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you go out for a run.  You start out at what you feel is a decent running pace. For the first few minutes, you feel pretty good. Your heart rate is low, your breathing rate is low, you aren't really perspiring very much...and that all lasts for awhile. Then everything starts to catch up to your effort.  Your pulse increases, you are breathing more rapidly, you are beginning to perspire.  You can hang in there, you just feel like you're working now. You keep your pace/effort steady. Now, you're 20 minutes in. You're flushed, you're gasping for breath, and you are certain that death is just around the corner. You somehow keep going...keeping both your pace and your level of suffering right about constant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you've arrived at what it feels like to run at that pace - *that is steady state*. Your work output, breathing, and metabolism are all in balance and nothing is changing as a function of time (as long as you keep your effort steady). Surely you've seen this - it takes some time for the level of pain to catch up to your level of effort, but eventually everything settles in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you make a perturbation to a system (in this case, the perturbation is you getting off the couch and starting to run), it takes time for the system to reach steady state. One way that we watch the approach to steady state is to monitor a variable that responds to perturbation as a function of time. In the running example, we could look at your heart rate, blood lactate concentration, or respiration rate.  Eventually, they will reach steady state, and we can roughly figure out how long it took to get there.  Next week, when we start on analyzing real data sets, I'll try to supply a power/heart rate data set vs. time for a bike race so that you all can process a big data set with pandas, but for now, let's just look at that approach to steady state in blood lactate levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume your blood lactate obeys the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{Lactate = Lactate_{SS} + (Lactate_0 - Lactate_{SS})}\\exp{(-kt)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Lactate is your blood lactate concentration in millimoles per liter (mM) at a given time since you started running. Lactate<sub>SS</sub> is the steady state blood lactate concentration at your current, near-death exertion level when running at a steady pace, and Lactate<sub>0</sub> is your blood lactate concentration at your more comfortable, sitting on the couch level when you started this run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say for simplicity Lactate<sub>0</sub> = 0.75 mM, Lactate<sub>SS</sub> = 12 mM, and k is a time constant that specifies the time scales over which your blood lactate concentration responds to your change in effort from couch to 10K.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a while loop to determine how long it takes for you to reach peak, steady state suffering.  How will I determine when I'm at steady state?  I will set an absolute error tolerance of 0.01. Once I get within 0.01 mM of my known steady state lactate concentration (12 mM), I will say that I have reached steady state. This bit of code then prints out the time needed to hit steady state and also plots blood lactate as a function of time. It works by initializing time, tolerance, and your lactate level, and then it updates all of them on each pass of the loop.  Here, we increment time by a single minute with every step; you may need to adjust that step size depending on the time scale of your process.  You may question why I picked a starting tolerance of 100.  I can pick anything as long as it is larger than my threshold tolerance.  I just need something bigger than 0.01 so that I can start the loop. **Another quick reminder:**  exp is not in base Python; you can either import it from the math package or use numpy.exp\n",
