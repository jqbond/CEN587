    "### Solution to Example Problem 01\n",
    "\n",
    "A differential tubular reactor is a bit of a different concept than what we've covered so far.  The idea is that you operate the reactor so close to 0% conversion that the composition is constant across the reactor.  We also generally would operate a differential reactor in such a way that the change in temperature and pressure across the reactor is neglible.  This is important because we generally expect that reaction rate depends on temperature, pressure, and composition.  If those three things are constant across the reactor Volume (or catalyst bed), then the reaction rate is also constant across the length of the reactor.  We start by writing a material balance on the tubular reactor.  In this case, it is a PFR:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dF_A}{dV} = R_A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a single reaction with a coefficient of -1 on A, so $R_A = -r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dF_A}{dV} = -r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we find that the derivative of molar flowrate with respect to volume would give us the reaction rate.  In this specific case of a differential reactor, we take advantage of the fact that the rate is constant with respect to reactor volume. Separating variables, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dF_A = -rdV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to integrate this from inlet to outlet of the PFR:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{F_{A,f}}^{F_A} dF_A = \\int_0^V-rdV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we take advantage of the fact that the rate is constant, so it is independent of volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{F_{A,f}}^{F_A} dF_A = -r\\int_0^VdV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So this equation becomes easy to solve.  We find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{A} - F_{A,f} = -rV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for r:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{F_{A,f} - F_A}{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we take the difference between the feed and exit molar flowrate of A, and we divide it by the volume of the reactor, we get an exact value of the reaction rate at the relevant concentration, temperature, and pressure at the reactor inlet. Note that if fluid density is constant, which it almost certainly is in a differential tubular reactor, then the following is also true.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{C_{A,f} - C_A}{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For both of the above expressions, you should see that they are identical to CSTR balances.  This is correct -- if we are operating a tubular reactor in such a way that the composition, temperature, and pressure are invariant across the reactor, then it is essentially a well-mixed flow reactor and the balance becomes a CSTR balance!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a problem here, though, because as $X_A \\rightarrow 0$, we know that $F_A \\rightarrow F_{A,f}$ and $C_F \\rightarrow C_{A,f}$. Limits on our ability to measure precise concentrations and flowrates will create serious problems in rate estimates at the zero conversion limit. We encountered this already in analyzing CSTR data obtained at very short values of $\\tau$, where conversion was nearly 0%.  As discussed previously for the CSTR example, our solution here is to focus on product formation instead of reactant consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Product Flowrates to estimate rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, our precision in quantifying the molar flowrate of species A coming out of the differential reactor is, at best, $\\pm 5\\%$.  That means the difference between the feed and exit flowrate of A is within our precision limits, and we get very noisy estimates of reaction rates if we try to quantify things this way. As we saw with the CSTR problem, when reactors are operated such that reactant conversion approaches zero, the better approach is to use reaction product measurements to estimate the rate of reaction.  The approach is very similar, we just start by writing a balance on a product instead of on a reactant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dF_B}{dV} = R_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single reaction where species B has a coefficient of 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dF_B}{dV} = r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll separate this ODE and integrate over the appropriate limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{F_{B,f}}^{F_B}dF_B = \\int_0^VrdV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we know that rate is not changing over the reactor volume, so r is a constant in this case.  This allows the following simplification:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{F_{B,f}}^{F_B}dF_B = r\\int_0^VdV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which makes the integration pretty straightforward.  We ultimately get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_B - F_{B,f} = rV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that there is no species B coming into the reactor, so $F_{B,f} = 0$.  We then solve for r:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{F_B}{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, since fluid density is almost certainly constant in a differential flow reactor, we can write express the above in terms of concentration and space time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{C_B}{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really a useful result, and we again see balances that are equivalent to the CSTR result!  It means that estimating the reaction rate just requires us to measure the flowrate of product coming out of the reactor and divide it by the reactor volume. That's the approach we'll use below. Importantly, when we base our rate estimates off of product formation, we do not have to worry about the issues that arise when we subtract two imprecise numbers that are nearly identical (e.g., $F_{A,f} - F_A$)"

    "### Azomethane Decomposition: A Possible Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "When scientists originally observed that unimolecular reactions like Azomethane decomposition were second order at low concentrations and first order at high concentrations, they considered phenomena that would lead to this observation.  An early concept was proposed by Lindemann and Christensen--in simple terms, their idea was that Azomethane (or a molecule like it) cannot undergo decomposition until it is \"activated\" by some energetic collision with a second Azomethane molecule. This collision would place the Azomethane into an excited state that is unstable and could do one of two things.  First, it could either dissipate this energy and return to its ground state without decomposing.  Second, it could decompose.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can translate that conceptual description of the molecular events underlying azomethane decomposition into a pair of elementary steps.  In general, we will assume that all elementary steps are reversible.  If we can convert reactants into products by passing through a high energy transition state, then we have to be able to traverse the same energetic pathway in reverse going from products, through the same transition state, and back to reactants (microscopic reversibility and detailed balance).  Each step, $i$, has a forward rate constant, $k_{i}$, a reverse rate constant, $k_{-i}$, and an equilibrium constant, $K_i$.  We may recall that for an elementary step, or for a step with elementary kinetics, the following is also true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_{C,i} = \\frac{k_{i}}{k_{-i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we propose the following set of elementary steps as the mechanism of Azomethane decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    &(1) \\qquad A + A \\rightleftharpoons A^* + A\\\\\n",
    "    &(2) \\qquad A^* \\rightleftharpoons B + C\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Another requirement of a reaction mechanism is that we have to be able to reproduce overall stoichiometry through a linear combination of elementary steps.  For example, in the above mechanism, if we add step (1) and step (2) together, we would get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\rightleftharpoons B + C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is the overall stoichiometry of azomethane decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll make a simplifying assumption that is based on our insight into a decomposition reaction.  These are generally thermodynamically very favorable ($\\Delta G < -100$ kJ/mol); as such, the equilibrium constant for the decomposition step and thus the overall reaction is very large, and we can assume both the second elementary step and the overall reaction are irreversible.  We'll update the steps accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    &(1) \\qquad A + A \\rightleftharpoons A^* + A\\\\\n",
    "    &(2) \\qquad A^* \\longrightarrow B + C\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\longrightarrow B + C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is the mechanism consistent with our observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next requirement of a mechanism is that it has to qualitatively agree with what we observe in the laboratory. In this case, this mechanism has to predict that the overall rate of reaction is 2nd order in A at low concentrations and first order in A at high concentrations.  If it does not, then it is either incorrect or at the very least an incomplete description of the chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not immediately clear how that mechanism will give us the overall reaction rate.  Considering the overall reaction rate, we see that, in the laboratory, a few things must be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    r &= -R_A \\\\\n",
    "    r &= R_B \\\\\n",
    "    r &= R_C \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can go to our mechanism to write any of those net production rates by considering the formation/consumption of each species through the elementary steps that comprise the mechanism.  So, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    R_A &= -r_1 \\\\\n",
    "    R_B &=  r_2  \\\\\n",
    "    R_C &=  r_2  \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, looking at that, we can make the following relationships between our overall rate and the rate of each elementary step:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    r &= r_1 \\\\\n",
    "    r &= r_2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "I can pick either one and work through the derivation.  Eventually, they will lead to the same place.  My preference is, when possible, to find the step where the product is formed, especially if it is an irreversible step.  This usually gives me a slightly less cumbersome starting equation.  This seems to be the general preference in textbooks as well.  With that established, let's say:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = r_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That tells us that the net rate of reaction has to be equal to the rate of the 2nd elementary step, which makes sense because it is the only step where our product, B, is formed.  Now, let's write out the rate expression for that step.  Since it is an elementary step, we can write it by inspection:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = r_2 = k_{2}{C_{A^*}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we run into a problem -- that isn't a convenient rate expression because it is written in terms of an activated, probably very reactive intermediate.  It is generally going to be very hard for us to observe this species in the reaction mixture, and we certainly can't control it, quantify it with lab instruments, or purchase it from a supplier.  It forms in situ and it is present only in trace quantities.  We would much rather have this rate expression written in terms of concentrations of stable species, namely A, B, and/or C.  The reason is that we can measure, control, quantify, etc. the concentrations of these species, so they are useful to us in designing and operating the reactor.  We therefore would like to **express** the concentration of the high energy species in terms of the stable species.  There are many ways we can approach this; all of them will generally involve some approximation about that species and the rate of its formation and consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pseudo steady state approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "For homogeneous reactions, we frequently will assume that these high energy intermediates (things like radicals, ions, high energy states, etc.) satisfy two requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Their formation is usually challenging (thermodynamically and kinetically), so they form slowly and are generally present in small quantities.\n",
    "2. They are reactive, so they tend to be consumed quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When these requirements are met, we generally consider that this species effectively reacts as soon as it forms, so its concentration in the system is not changing appreciably.  In other words, its net production rate is zero.  This is generally called the **Pseudo Steady State Assumption** or various forms of that (Pseudo Steady State Hypothesis, Quasi Steady State Assumption, Quasi Steady State Hypothesis).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We first write the production rate for the high energy intermediate $A^*$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{A^*} = r_1 - r_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we apply the PSSH by setting the net production rate to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = r_1 - r_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that this leads to the conclusion that $r_1 = r_2$, but we'll work with the above form here)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now substitute rate expressions into the PSSH equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = k_1{C_A}^2 - k_{-1}C_{A^*}C_A - k_2C_{A^*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the beauty and utility of that approximation become clear: we have an equation written in one \"unknown\", $C_{A^*}$. This means that we can solve the above to develop an expression for $C_{A^*}$ as a function of $C_A$ and various rate constants.  Doing so, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{A^*} = \\frac{k_1 {C_A}^2}{k_2 + k_{-1}C_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can substitute that back into my rate expression for step 2 (which is equal to the rate of product formation and thus the overall rate of reaction):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{k_1 k_2 {C_A}^2}{k_2 + k_{-1}C_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to simplify this just a little, mostly because I like the first term in the denominator polynomial to be a 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{k_1 {C_A}^2}{1 + K^\\prime C_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we define $K^\\prime = k_{-1}/k_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reconciliation with Observed trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have an overall rate expression written only in terms of $C_A$ and various kinetic parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{k_1 {C_A}^2}{1 + K^\\prime C_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go further, let's make sure that this expression at least *can* predict the behavior we observe in the reactor.  We know that this reaction appears 2nd order in Azomethane (A) at low concentrations and first order in A at high concentrations.  We can determine if the rate expression can predict this with an analysis of limiting behavior.  First, let's consider the limit as $C_A \\rightarrow 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Low concentration limit\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the overall rate clearly approaches zero, but that's not what we're interested in.  We're interested in how the rate responds to changes in the concentration of A at low concentrations.  So we look at dominant terms in the numerator and denominator as $C_A \\rightarrow 0$. In this regime, the dominant term in the numerator is $kC_A^2$.  In other words, the numerator has a second order dependence on $C_A$ in the limit of low concentration.  If we look at the denominator, we see that, as $C_A \\rightarrow 0$, then $1 >> K^\\prime C_A$.  Accordingly, the dominant term in the denominator is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these behaviors established, we conclude that at low concentrations, the rate of reaction should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{k_1 {C_A}^2}{1} = k_1 {C_A}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the rate of reaction is second order in A at low concentrations, just as observed in experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High concentration limit\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll let $C_A \\rightarrow \\infty$ and repeat analysis of dominant terms in the numerator and denominator.  The dominant term in the numerator is again $k_1C_A^2$, so the numerator still has a second order dependence on the concentration of A. Looking at the denominator, as $C_A \\rightarrow \\infty$, then $1 << K^\\prime C_A$.  So the second term is dominant, and our rate expression becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{k_1 {C_A}^2}{K^\\prime C_A} = \\frac{k_1}{K^\\prime} {C_A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, at high concentrations of A, the reaction is first order in A, just as observed in laboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this analysis, we can conclude that this mechanism is consistent with our observations in the laboratory.  We can't prove it, of course, but we can say that it captures our observations and so is at least plausible.  We now would proceed to trying to estimate the values of our two parameters, $k_1$ and $K^\\prime$ based on analysis of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this in a few ways.  The most obvious and straightforward is to use nonlinear regression.  That is, we would minimize the sum of squares of errors by optimizing the values of the two parameters.  This is implemented in the cell below.  Notice that I'm defining my residual error as a percentage error here instead of an absolute error.  This is because the rates measured vary over orders of magnitude, and absolute errors for numbers like $10^{-8}$ are small compared to those for numbers like 1 or 10.  The percent error is scaled, so it makes sure our regression weights small measurements correctly."
