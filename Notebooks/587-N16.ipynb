    "## Rate Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point, we have learned that, ***for homogeneous reactions***, we will always compute the Extensive generation/consumption rate for species $j$, $G_j$ by scaling the intensive production rate, $R_j$, in units of moles per volume to the volume of the reactor, $V$. Generally, this must be done by allowing that $R_j$ can vary spatially throughout the reactor due to variations in temperature, pressure, and/or composition within the reactor volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G_j = \\int^V R_jdV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the intensive production rate of species $j$, $R_j$, by summing contributions from individual reactions, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_j = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N_R} \\nu_{i,j} \\, r_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a well-mixed reactor, $R_j$ is spatially invariant (i.e., it is not a function of volume or position), so this volume integral simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G_j = R_jV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we define $G_j$ in terms of $R_j$, and we define $R_j$ in terms of $\\nu_{i,j}$ and $r_i$. We know what the stoichiometric coefficient for species $j$ in reaction $i$, $\\nu_{i,j}$, means. But we have not yet discussed how $r_i$ is defined or calculated, only that it is determined by the temperature, pressure, and composition of the reacting phase. The nature of that function is a topic for a focused discussion on kinetics, which we'll touch on starting with [Notebook 36](https://jqbond.github.io/CEN587/Notebook36/587-N36.html). A detailed understanding of chemical kinetics requires graduate-level training in physical chemistry, kinetics, and/or catalysis; fortunately, this is not necessary for a typical course in Chemical Reaction Engineering. At this moment in the course, we only need to think of the reaction rate, $r_i$ as some ***function*** that tells us how quickly a given reaction occurs for a specific combination of temperature, pressure, and species composition. We will call these functions ***rate laws*** or ***rate expressions***, and they are what will allow us to calculate the reaction rate under any conditions that our reactor is operating.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_i = f(T, P, x_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless rate expressions, but there are some common ways that we'll discuss them. The main thing to remember is that a rate expression will simply ***tell us the specific way that the rate of reaction, $r_i$ depends on temperature, pressure, and composition***. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature Dependence (Rate Constants)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use rate constants to capture the temperature dependence of the reaction.  When we use rate constants in this course, we assume that we will always be able to capture their temperature dependence using an Arrhenius expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_i = A_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_{A_i}}{RT}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A rate constant, $k_i$, is generally going to be specific to a reaction, $r_i$. Here, $A_i$ is an Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, and $E_{A_i}$ is the activation barrier for this specific reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition and Pressure Dependencies (Reaction Orders)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate constants are multiplied by composition and/or pressure to calculate a reaction rate. In this course, we will usually describe these dependencies using concentrations, $C_j$, or partial pressures, $p_j$.  The latter is common for gas-phase reactions, and it should make physical sense as well because partial pressures are easily related to concentrations, e.g., for an ideal gas:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_j = \\frac{p_j}{RT}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We often specify composition dependencies through reaction orders, which tell us how a reaction rate scales with the composition of a species. For example, if a reaction is \"first order in A\", we would write $r = kC_A$. If it is second order in A, we would write $r = k{C_A}^2$. If it is first order in A and second order in B, we would write $r = kC_A{C_B}^2$. We will generally need to be told what the reaction orders and rate constants are. Otherwise, we'll have to be provided data that allows us to estimate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "No matter what reaction orders we have, the rate of reaction should always have intensive units, such as $r [=] \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{vol \\ time}}$. Because of this, we should expect that the dimensions of the rate constant will change depending on the reaction order.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reversible Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "When a reaction can proceed in either the forward or the reverse direction, we have to account for the rates of both of those processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\rightleftharpoons B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by writing a net rate of reaction, which is the difference between forward and reverse reaction rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = r_f - r_r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall vs. elementary reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "For a generic ***overall*** reaction that describes stoichiometric changes that we observe in the laboratory:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nu_A A + \\nu_B B \\rightleftharpoons \\nu_C C + \\nu_D D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We **CANNOT** define a rate law by inspection of stoichiometry. At best, we can propose that the rate of that reaction may depend on all of the species participating in that reaction with some unknown reaction order. So if you have to propose a hypothetical rate law for the overall, reversible reaction above, at best, we could only say something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k_f{C_A}^{\\alpha_f} {C_B}^{\\beta_f} {C_C}^{\\gamma_f} {C_D}^{\\delta_f} - k_r{C_A}^{\\alpha_r} {C_B}^{\\beta_r} {C_C}^{\\gamma_r} {C_D}^{\\delta_r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the exponents represent unknown reaction orders. Commonly, reactions (especially catalytic reactions) do not follow power law kinetics, and we can usually only say something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = f(T, C_A, C_B, C_C, C_D)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot know the nature of that function without doing experiments to determine how the reaction rate changes in response to variations in temperature, pressure, and/or species composition. ***In the rare event we are working with an elementary step***, or if we are told that the reaction \"has an elementary rate law\", then we know the reaction occurs exactly as written, and we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k_f{C_A}^{\\nu_A} {C_B}^{\\nu_B} - k_r{C_C}^{\\nu_C} {C_D}^{\\nu_D}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex kinetics\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no guarantee we will have a simple power law model of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k{C_A}^\\alpha {C_B}^\\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, especially for catalytic and enzymatic reactions, we will observe more complex rate laws. A common example is something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{k {C_A} {C_B}}{1 + K_A{C_A} + K_B{C_B}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, there is no definitive reaction order for a species, and we frequently observe that reaction orders will change depending on the temperature, pressure, and composition where we study the kinetics of that system. Although rate laws can become very complicated, for our purposes, they always accomplish the same thing---they are simply functions. We pass them temperatures, pressures, and compositions as arguments, and they return the value of the intensive reaction rate. We then use this to compute species production rates, $R_j$, and the overall extensive rate of production by chemical reaction, $G_j$."

    "Almost every time we see questions that ask us how long a reaction needs to occur, how large a reactor needs to be, or what residence time will be necessary, we should view these as prompts that motivate us to write a material balance. Why? These are fundamentally extensive questions above the extent of reaction that occurs in a reactor having a given size or residence time. The material balance is what describes the extensive changes in species quantity that occur in a reacting system. In this question, we are asked to consider the time required to achieve 80% conversion of species $A$ in a batch reactor, so we begin by writing a material balance on $A$ in a well-mixed batch reactor:\n",

    "\n",
    "If we take stock of this equation, we see that the left hand side is a single, first derivative expressed in terms of one independent variable, $t$, and one state dependent variable, $N_A$. We can solve this differential equation as long as everything on the right hand side is expressed in terms of (1) our state variabe, $N_A$, (2) our independent variable, $t$, and/or (3) constants that do not change as a function of $N_A$ or $t$. As we analyze the right hand side of this equation, we see that it is defined in terms of two constants, $k$ and $V$, and the concentration of species $A$, $C_A$. We should recognize that $C_A$ is an implicit function of both $N_A$ and $t$. Specifically, $C_A = N_A/V$. For a fixed volume, this means that as $N_A$ changes, so must $C_A$. As such, $C_A$ is an implicit function of time because, in a batch reactor, $N_A$ will change as time progresses. We can probably solve this analytically if we can find a way to separate variables, but before we can separate variables, we need to resolve the dependence on $N_A$ buried inside of $C_A$. There are numerous ways to do this; here, we will choose to do so by expressing concentration as a function of $N_A$ and $V$:\n",
