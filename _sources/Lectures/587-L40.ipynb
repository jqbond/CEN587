    "## Brief Review of the Need For Energy Balances\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we've always considered isothermal reactors.  We have often considered the effect of changing temperature on a rate constant, but as far as the reactor is concerned, we have always assumed that the entire reactor exists at a single temperature that is equal to the temperature at the start of the run (in a batch reactor) or the temperatuer of the feed (in a flow reactor).  These would be *isothermal* reactors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know after courses in mass and energy balances and thermodynamics that most reactions are not thermoneutral.  This means that most reactions have a non-zero heat of reaction ($\\Delta H$), so they will either release energy to or absorb energy from the environment.  As this happens, we should anticipate that the temperature inside of the reactor may change considerably. From a strict chemistry standpoint, this is important for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rate constants have an exponential dependence on temperature\n",
    "2. Equilibrium constants have an exponential dependence on temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, changing the reaction temperature over the course of reaction progress can dramatically impact how favorable reaction is (thermodynamics, equilibrium constant) and how fast the reaction occurs (kinetics, rate constant).  So it is extremely important that we understand how to anticipate changes in temperature as a function of reaction progress, reaction time, and/or reactor size.  We do this by writing energy balances on the reactor of interest.  We can use the same basic concept that we did for material balances -- we envision a shell balance on the reactor, and we consider the energy entering, leaving, and accumulating in that control volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in the derivation of the reactor energy balances starting from a shell balance, please see Lecture 39, where the steps are outlined in detail. It is rare that we will need to go back to the starting point in general, and in all problems we will consider this semester, we will only work with the following, useful forms of the energy balance.\n",

    "We could actually solve this as is by combining it with material balances on A, B, and C (see Example Problem 03 below), but the problem statement does not ask us anything about how long it takes to achieve a maximum temperature increase, it only asks what the maximum temperature increase is.  This means we don't really need to integrate the problem in the time domain, we are really only interested in the increase in temperature as a function of reaction progress.  Clearly, the further this exothermic reaction goes toward completion ($X_A = 1$), the higher the temperature will increase. The relationship between temperature and conversion in an adiabatic process is usually called the \"adiabatic temperature change\" for a reaction, and it is a very important quantity for us to be able to estimate.  To facilitate an analytical solution, we'd like to reduce this to a single ODE instead of having to solve multiple, coupled ODEs.  We do this by substituting a material balance into the energy balance.\n",
