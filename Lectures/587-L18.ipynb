    "\n",
    "Since this problem asks how long it will take to achieve a specific fractional conversion of A, my instinct is to write a material balance on A for this well-mixed batch reactor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = R_AV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We define $R_A$ as usual to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_A = -r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we are given reaction orders, so we can write a rate expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k_fC_A - k_rC_B^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see our first complication: the rate of reaction depends on the concentration of species B.  Our next complication arises when we define concentration.  Since we are in a batch reactor and working with $N_A$ and $N_B$ as state dependent variables, we define concentrations for A and B as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    C_A &= N_A/V \\\\\n",
    "    C_B &= N_B/V\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the volume appears here. These concentrations represent the concentration in the reactor at any point in time, t.  So, relative to the starting point, $N_A$ and $N_B$ are both changing.  The less obvious thing is that the volume of the reactor is also changing.  Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reactor temperature and pressure are fixed at 298K and 1 atm, respectively.  Because the pressure is low, we can use the ideal gas law to define the volume of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = \\frac{N_TRT}{P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, for a fixed temperature and pressure, the volume of the reactor scales directly with the total number of moles in the reactor. For this reaction, we can see clearly that every time the reaction occurs, it consumes 1 mole of A and produces 4 moles of B.  This means the reaction causes an increase in the number of moles in the system, so as it progresses, the volume of the reactor must increase to maintain a constant temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we also have to keep track of the total number of moles in our system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_T = N_A + N_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, the easiest way to handle this is to just write a balance on each species and solve the set of coupled differential equations numerically:\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\frac{dN_A}{dt} = R_AV \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{dN_B}{dt} = R_BV\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we just make sure that everything on the right hand side of those two balances is defined in terms of contants or the three variables tracked by our ODE solver (t, NA, NB).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    R_A = -r \\\\\n",
    "    R_B = 4r\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where rate is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = k_fC_A - k_rC_B^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we need to define concentrations in terms of NA and NB:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    C_A = N_A/V \\\\\n",
    "    C_B = N_B/V\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "And we know that Volume can be defined in terms of the total moles in the system; hence we define:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_T = N_A + N_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And use this result with the ideal gas law to calculate system volume.\n",
    "\n",
