    "## Review: Flow Reactors in Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past couple of weeks, we have considered the idea of reactor sequencing for flow reactors. That is, we have considered whether it would be beneficial to use more than one flow reactor arranged in a sequence in order to accomplish a certain transformation. For now, we're only considering reactors in series where the outflow from one is the inflow to the next. For now, we are only really concerned with concepts about how placing reactors in sequences effects the process, and so we are looking at a very simple reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\longrightarrow B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we perform this reaction in a CSTR or a PFR, we can assume that the temperature, pressure, density, volume, and volumetric flowrate associated with these processes are constant with respect to time and position in the reactor. With those simplifying assumptions, we can write balances for the \"nth\" reactor in that system, e.g., for a CSTR:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_n = \\frac {F_{A_f}(x_{A_n} - x_{A_{n-1}})}{r(x_{A_n})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And for a PFR:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_n = \\int_{x_{A_{n-1}}}^{x_{A_n}} \\frac{F_{A_f}}{r(x_A)}dx_A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will specifically consider reactor sizing for the case where the reaction given above is first order in species A such that $r = kC_A$; further, we are given the following information about this reactor:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    k &= 1 \\ \\textrm{min}^{-1} \\\\\n",
    "    F_{A_f} &= 1 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{min}^{-1} \\\\\n",
    "    C_{A_f} &= 1 \\ \\textrm{mol} \\ \\textrm{L}^{-1} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Balances on the n<sup>th</sup> PFR and CSTR in a series\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed the following balances for the nth CSTR and PFR during class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{CSTR} = \\frac{F_{Af}(x_{A_n} - x_{A_{n-1}})}{kC_{A_f}(1 - x_{A_n})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{PFR} = \\int_{x_{A_{n-1}}}^{x_{A_n}} \\frac{F_{A_f}}{r(x_A)}dx_A $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 90% conversion in a single flow reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "We can substitute the information in the problem statement to compute the size of a single CSTR and a single PFR to achieve 90% conversion of species A.  Doing so, we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{CSTR} = \\frac{F_{Af}(x_{A_n} - x_{A_{n-1}})}{kC_{A_f}(1 - x_{A_n})} = \\frac{0.9}{(1-0.9)} \\textrm{L} = 9.0 \\textrm{L}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Both of these models are embedded in the next cell as lambda functions.  They will calculate the volume of a single CSTR or PFR required to achieve any fractional conversion in this reactor.  I've also plotted them so that you can see how the difference in sizes grows as the fractional conversion increases.  This makes sense if you think about the requirement that the entire volume of the CSTR operates at the exit concentration, i.e., where the reaction rate is at its lowest (for a positive order reaction)."
