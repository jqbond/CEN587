    "# Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, particularly with data analysis, it is often either necessary or just ***really, really useful*** for us to work with collections of \"things\" instead of single, scalar values. You are probably familiar with this concept from your introductions to Matlab, which uses specific types of collections called arrays and matrices. Python includes support for both arrays and matrices in addition to several other types of collections that we might be less familiar with. As with scalars, each type of collection has unique properties that determine how we interact with them at the Python console and the applications they can or should be used for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of collections comprise the various **data structures** that we can use in Python. In Engineering courses, the ones that we will encounter most are probably **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **numpy arrays**. It is important to understand that the first three data structures given here (lists, tuples, and dictionaries) are part of base Python; however, these aren't necessarily the most convenient data structures for performing mathematical operations. In engineering courses, we're generally going to be happiest working with numpy arrays as they have a lot of the behavior we may come to expect in math programming languages based on experience with, e.g., Matlab. That said, numpy arrays are not a default data structure in Python -- numpy arrays are accessible only after we add support for them, and they are mostly used in numerical and scientific packages (e.g., numpy, scipy), which we have to specifically add to enrich the features of base Python. Almost certainly, we will sometimes need to work with other types of data strucyures, so it is important to know that these all exist, what their different properties are, and how you would create them in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "At a minimum, you should be aware that **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **numpy arrays** exist and that they are all different types of data structures that collect sets of things. They all have very different properites, you use each of them in different scenarios, and some are more useful than others for mathematics, linear algebra, and numerical methods.  You will need to know how to identify them and construct them, and you will also need to be aware of their basic properties, even if you don't use all of them evey day in your own codes.\n",

    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a versatile type of collection. They are the main workhorse data structure in base Python. Lists are frequently the default data structure in Python if you don't explicitly format things as a numpy array (numpy arrays will be addressed later). So you'll probably have to work with them at some point. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The terminology \"base Python\" used here means that lists are \"built in\" to the Python base. To use arrays, we generally add a package (numpy), so numpy arrays are not part of \"base Python.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an indexed, **mutable** set of \"items\" that are ordered, i.e., each entry has a unique index, much like the elements in a string. The \"items\" in a list can include any type of scalar or any type of collection and there are really few restrictions on what can be stored in a list structure. Because lists are **mutable**, we can we can change their contents after they are created. As with strings, we can specify a specific index in a list using bracket notation `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a list\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the most convenient way to define a list from a set of elements is using brackets `[]`. Some examples are included in the cell below. In these examples, `G` is a ***list of integers***; `H` is a ***list of strings***; and `I` is a ***list of lists***, and each list inside is itself a list of floating point numbers. Notice that, when creating the multi-level list `I`, the top level list is defined with a pair of brackets, and each list inside of that list is also defined with a pair of brackets.  This is a universal syntax in Python for defining multi-level lists and tuples, and it extends to creating N-dimensional arrays, which we use to create matrices. In the example below, we are making use of the `print()` and `type()` functions that we learned previously to display each list and its class."

It is worth learning how to use this constructor for two reasons.  First, it can be far more efficient to create large lists by passing iterables (like `range()`) to the `list()` constructor. Second, this type of constructor is pretty universal in Python. Of interst here, there are analogs that we'll see below for creating tuples, dictionaries, and numpy arrays. Note again that we are making use of the `print()` and `type()` functions that we learned previously to display each list and its class."

Execute these commands in the cell below to get a feel for how lists respond to manipulation; note the use of brackets `[]` here to specify index = 1 in the list J.

You will save yourself some confusion if you just remember that ***lists are not matrices, and they do not behave like matrices either in indexing or in mathematical operations***. They are a one dimensional collection that just has a length associated with them, and each element in that list has an index. Now, each element in a list might be another list...and perhaps that extends for multiple levels (a list of lists of lists).

    "Dictionaries are different.  The entries are not ordered.  They are arranged as a set of *key:value* pairs (just like a real dictionary has a word:definition pair). You store key:value pairs when you create a dictionary, and when you need to recall a specific value, you do so by passing the key associated with that value into the dictionary name.  For example, lets say you have a dictionary containing the core members of the Grateful Dead in 1977 sorted by their roles in the band.  You can create a dictionary in two ways; the first is using curly braces `{}`. You just add key:value pairs as a comma-separated series inside of the braces, and that gives you a dictionary.  Generally, you have flexibility as to what can be a key and what can be a value.  Usually I end up having either strings or numbers as keys and strings or numbers as values...but sometimes you may have lists, tuples, etc. as values. It is worth displaying the dictionary just to see what how it is stored; you can do this with `print()`"

Generaly speaking, arrays are **mutable**, ordered collections in which each element has a specific index. They can include any type of scalar or collection, so they are superficially similar to lists, but they have some important differences. One of the major ones, in simple terms is that you can *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on an array, whereas you cannot *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on a list (this is addressed in more detail in Module 03). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, arrays have some nice benefits. Most of the numerical methods and linear algebra operations that we use for solving engineering problems use arrays as their default data structure.  Further, arrays natively allow vectorized/element-wise operations (Module 03), which is something we frequently want to do. If you are familiar with Matlab, the \"array\" class in Python behaves similarly to the vectors and matrices that you're used to working with in Matlab (whereas lists, tuples, and dictionaries do not). To me, coming from a Matlab background, working with lists *feels* awkward, but working with arrays feels familiar.\n",

In a commercial math software package like Matlab, more often than not, we mostly use features that are built into the language and accessible by default in the base of that language. In contrast, we frequently will need to add functionality to Python that is missing from the base. We do this by adding packages. \n",

A list will not; it interacts with math operators differently than you might expect if you're coming from a Matlab background.  Generally speaking, the default behavior of a list is that it will interpret a math operation as a concatenation, whereas an array will execute that math operation on each element of the array. Many times, there is no logical way to interpret a math operation as a concatenation, so math on lists will throw an error.
