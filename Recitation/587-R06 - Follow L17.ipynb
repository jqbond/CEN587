In this case, the better strategy is to write a separate balance on species B, which now gives us two ODEs written in two state dependent variables, $N_A$ and $N_B$.  Everything on the right hand side of these ODEs is now either a constant or a function of those two state variables, and we can solve this with numerical tools in `solve_ivp()`.\n",
