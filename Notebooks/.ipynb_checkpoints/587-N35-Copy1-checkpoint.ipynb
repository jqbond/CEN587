We have first order kinetics and a constant volumetric flowrate; further, we know the size of the reactor!. This means that the PFR balance can be solved analytically, and we can replace the differential equation with an algebraic one and proceed as normal with an equation solver.\n",

    "We still need to solve a system of algebraic equations as above, but the catch now is that the differential equation that describes the PFR balance is more cumbersome to solve. I don't know an analytical solution offhand. We *could* develop one after separating variables. That said, in my opinion, it will be easier and cleaner to use numerical methods to integrate it. For this solution, we'll use `solve_ivp()` because it is relatively easy to implement a Runge-Kutta method here since we know the upper limit of integration (V = 400L). You could also do this with Gaussian Quadrature, but I prefer the `solve_ivp()` approach as it is easier to extend to more difficult systems that involve several coupled ODEs. This is an important technique to learn because you will not always be able to solve ODEs analytically."
