    "We introduced the idea that a reactor-with-recycle process could be used to attain high overall (process-level) conversion for reactions that, for some reason, need to be limited to a low single pass (once through the reactor) conversion. The only scenario we have considered so far is an equilibrium-limited reaction (propane dehydrogenation), but reactor-with-recycle schemes can also be used to improve overall yields when dealing with sequential reactions.  Specifically, it allows one to operate the reactor at relatively low single-pass conversion to avoid secondary reactions, but it recycles the remainder to allow a high overall conversion."

    "For the above case, things aren't so bad because we have first order kinetics and a constant volumetric flowrate, which means that we can solve the differential equation (balance on the PFR) analytically and just replace the algebraic equation from our CSTR system with one that describes the PFR.\n",

    "Where $k = 10 \\ \\textrm{s}^{-1}$ as before and $K = 17.5 \\ \\textrm{L} \\ \\textrm{mol}^{-1}$.  Otherwise, the problem is identical. For this process, we are feeding species A in at a rate of 100 moles per second.  The entire process is carried out at T = 573K and P = 1.0 atm. If the volume of the PFR is 400L, and we recycle 50% of the unreacted species A, calculate the single pass and overall conversion of A achieved in this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We still need to solve a system of algebraic equations as above, but the catch now is that the differential equation that describes the PFR balance is more cumbersome to solve. I don't know an analytical solution offhand, but we *could* develop one after separating variables. That said, in my opininon, it will be easier and cleaner to use numerical methods to integrate it. For this solution, we'll use `solve_ivp()` because it is relatively easy to implement a Runge-Kutta method here since we know the upper limit of integration (V = 400L). You could also do this with Gaussian Quadrature, but I prefer the `solve_ivp()` approach as it is easier to extend to more difficult systems that involve several coupled ODEs. This is an important technique to learn because you will not always be able to solve ODEs analytically."
