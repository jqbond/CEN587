A material balance is how we mathematically model the change in species quantiy in a reactor, so we will start by writing a material balance species $A$. For a PFR operating at Steady State (see [Notebook 15](https://jqbond.github.io/CEN587/Notebooks/587-N15.html#tubular-reactor-plug-flow-reactor)), the balance on species A is given by:\n",

We recognize that $C_A$ is an implicit function of $F_A$ and vice-versa, so we cannot yet solve the problem. We first need to explicitly define the relationship between $F_A$ and $C_A$.

We know that we should be able to solve this problem as long as the right hand side is fully expressed in terms of (1) our state varible, (2) our independent variable, and (3) constants that do not change as a function of position in the reactor. As we look at the right hand side of this ODE, we see that it is not fully expressed in terms of these things. Rather, it is expressed in terms of one constant, $k$, and two concentrations that vary as a function of position in the reactor, $C_A$ and $C_B$. Taking stock, we can determine that there are a total of 3 quantities in this equation that are changing with position, $V$, in the reactor: $F_A$, $C_A$, and $C_B$. If we want an analytical solution, we need to find a way to express all of these volume-dependent quantities in terms of a single state variable. We can do that in several ways--none of them are necessarily better or worse than any other, though some approaches may be more-or-less convenient depending on the nature of the problem. For this one, my personal favorite choice for developing an analytical solution would be to express all species flowrates and concentrations as functions of either extent of reaction, $\\varepsilon$, or fractional conversion of one reactant, e.g., $X_A$.  \n",
