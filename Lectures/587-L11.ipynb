With that in mind, our species balance on an arbitrary reactor:\n",

It represents how quickly species $j$ is either consumed or produced by chemical reaction(s) that are occuring inside of our reactor in **extensive** units of **moles-per-time**.

    "## A conceptual definition of a reaction rate\n",
    "\n",
    "I have always liked the way that reaction rates are conceptually defined in Boudart's textbook *Kinetics of Chemical Processes*. They are not defined in terms of a species, rather, they are defined in terms of the amount of \"reaction\" that has occured.  Namely reaction rates are defined in terms of an extent of reaction, which we know is an extensive quantity that describes how many \"moles of reaction\" have occured.  We want to transform that idea into a rate, specifically, into a rate of how many moles of reaction have occurred. At least from a dimensional standpoint, one could define an extensive rate of reaction as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{r} = \\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon}{\\Delta t} \\ [=] \\ \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{time}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the extent of reaction, $\\varepsilon$ is an extensive variable, the above definition of $\\bar{r}$ is an extensive rate of reaction, i.e., it varies with the scale of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intensive rates of reaction are more useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we prefer to work with *intensive* reaction rates.  The reason for this is that, fundamentally, a reaction rate should be a function of only ($T, P, x_j$).  It should not depend on the type of reactor we are using or the size of that system.  This ensures that when I study kinetics in a small scale system, those results will apply to a process at ExxonMobil that carries out the same reaction in a large system.  Intensive reaction rates ensure the data are univeral and apply for a given ($T, P, x_j$) regardless of the reactor, which is much more useful than an extensive reaction rate that changes every time we change the reactor.  Accordingly, we will always work with intensive reaction rates that are normalized to a unit dimension of \"size\" or \"scale\" that describes our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in Lecture 10, what constitutes the appropriate dimensional scaling depends on the type of reaction.  For homogeneous reactions that occur throughout the space occupied by the reaction mixture, volume is a good description of system size as it is clear that increasing the volume of the reactor (for a fixed concentration of reactants) will increase the extensive quantity of reaction that is occuring. In other cases, catalyst mass, interfacial surface area, or even number of surface active sites may be appropriate bases for normalizing reaction rates.  With this in mind, we present a few general conceptual definitions of reaction rates in various systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homogeneous Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "For homogeneous reactions that occur throughout the space occupied by reaction media, volume is a good basis for normalizing reaction rates; hence, our convention for homogeneous systems is to report intensive reaction rates normalized to unit volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon}{\\Delta t \\ \\Delta V} \\ [=] \\ \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{volume} \\cdot \\text{time}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heterogeneous Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Catalytic reactions (e.g., in a packed bed)\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the reaction occurs on a catalyst, reactor volume is a much less relevant description of the reactor scale than the amount of catalyst present in the reactor. In practice, for catalytic reactions, we frequently will see intensive reaction rates reported per unit mass of catalyst.  This makes sense because the *extensive* productivity of a catalytic reactor scales with the mass of catalyst in the reactor much moreso than the volume of the reactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^\\prime = \\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon}{\\Delta t \\ \\Delta W} \\ [=] \\ \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{mass of catalyst} \\cdot \\text{time}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Scott Fogler's textbook (*Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering*) uses the symbol $W$ for catalyst mass (catalyst \"weight\").  This has become standard notation for packed bed and fluidized bed reactors, so we'll use it here.  In our course, we'll also use Fogler's convention of using the symbol $r^\\prime$ to indicate mass-normalized reaction rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reactions at interfaces between phases\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a reaction occurs only at an interface between two phases.  In these cases, the extensive \"scale\" of the reaction is best described in terms of that interfacial area.  When we have a reaction that occurs over a 2D surface or 2D interface between phases, it is often convenient for us to report reaction rates per unit area. Again, this is because the interfacial area is far more important than the total volume occupied in determining the overall, extensive performance of the reactor.  In these cases, we might see a rate definition like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon}{\\Delta t \\ \\Delta A} \\ [=] \\ \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{interfacial area} \\cdot \\text{time}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reactions at specific active sites on a surface\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked in class about how catalysts are frequently comprised of expensive metals like Pt or Pd.  In those cases, we almost never use a bulk sample of pure Pt or Pd.  Instead, we disperse nanometer sized particles of Pt or Pd onto a high surface area carrier like silica or alumina.  Frequently, the silica and alumina do nothing in terms of catalysis--they are there as a host for Pt or Pd nanoparticles.  In these situations, the vast majority of catalyst mass or even catalyst surface area in the reactor is inert. Only a few exposed surface atoms or Pt or Pd are doing the catalysis, so the mass of catalyst and the surface area of the interface between the catalyst and the bulk fluid become somewhat poor descriptions of the size of the system.  Instead, it is better for us to think of the reactor \"size\" in terms of the number of Pt or Pd atoms that are accessible in that system.  This is a common convention in fundamental catalysis, where we usually report rates of reaction per active site (e.g., per $H^+$, per Pt atom, per $Al^{3+}$ cation in an alumina lattice, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon}{\\Delta t \\ \\Delta S} \\ [=] \\ \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{active site} \\cdot \\text{time}}$$\n",

    "I can relate the rate of reaction to the production rate of a species using stoichiometric coefficients.  This is similar to what we do with extents of reaction in completing a mole table for equilibrium problems.  For example, if I wanted to define the number of moles of A and B as functions of reaction extent, I would write:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{R_j}{\\nu_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no restriction that a species is only participating in one reaction in a given reactor.  In fact, the more realistic scenario is that every species is actually participating in multiple reactions.  This means that it is being consumed or produced by multiple chemical reactions, and so when we define its production rate, $R_j$, we actually need to account for the rate of consumption from many chemical reactions.  We'll do this with an intuitive example and then present a general equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider partial and complete combustion pathways that occur during methane oxidation:\n",
    "\n",

Analogous to our solution of multiple reaction equilibria using mole (ICE) tables, we just add up the consumption or production rate for each species in each reaction.  So for methane ($CH_4$), we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{CH_4} = -1r_1 - 1r_2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "From that exercise, it makes sense that we can formally calculate an intensive production rate for any species, $j$, by summing up the intensive production rate for that species in each reaction that is occuring in the system.
