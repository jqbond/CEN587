    "\n",
    "Your mathematics and introductory engineering courses have given you a lot of problems that you were able to solve by hand (i.e., analytically) to obtain closed-form solutions using pencil-and-paper and, at most, a calculator. This is not generally the case in engineering practice, especially in reactor design. We frequently have to solve equations or sets of equations that have no straightforward analytical solution. These are usually, at best, tedious to solve by hand and, at worst, impossible to solve by hand. In these cases, we have to rely on numerical methods, which use simple mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to provide an approximation of the true solution. We will use numerical methods extensively in this course. so we will introduce a few of the key tools for solving various types of equations in this notebook, and then we'll get a lot of practice with them for the rest of the semester. Here, we will cover the basics of solving ***algebraic equations*** analytically, graphically, and using numerical methods. We will use these tools for solving problems in ***Chemical Equilibrium*** and ***Reactor Design***. \n",

    "From this, we can see there is one root near $x = -2$, and there is another root near $x = 12$. This is consistent with our quadratic formula solution. Graphing isn't the most precise method, but it allows us to very quickly identify the rough location of roots, so it is extremely useful. Beyond this (and assuming we cannot solve the problem analytically), we have to rely on numerical methods, which are usually iterative in nature. This means that we make a guess at the solution, we check the answer to see how close we are to zero, and then we change our guess based on how close we are to zero.  The hope is that we move steadily toward the solution as we continue to revise our guesses.\n",

This is implemented in the cell below, where we repeatedly pass values of x to our function f(x) until it returns a value that is sufficiently close to zero for our satisfaction..."

    "Although it is intuitive, guess and check is an inefficient way to solve this problem.  It requires that we inspect each solution and make decisions about the next guess. Although we can generally find the root of a simple univarate funtion like $f(x)$ above, it is always tedious. Further, it is almost impossible to solve systems of nonlinear equations using a guess and check method. Generally speaking, it is preferable to use a formal numerical method to solve algebraic equations. These approaches are usually still iterative in nature, but they use more sophisticated mathematics to update guesses in a way that moves efficiently toward the root. One of the most straightforward of these approaches is the Newton-Raphson method.\n",

The Newton-Raphson iteration is much better than what we did above because it uses information about both the function value and its derivative to update guesses automatically. The formula for the Newton-Raphson iteration is this:\n",

    "We make an initial guess, $x_i$, then we update that guess by subtracting the ratio of the function value at $x_i$, $f(x_i)$, to its derivative at $x_i$, $f^\\prime(x_i)$. The sign of the function value and the derivative of the function value ensure that guesses are updated in a fashion that moves them toward the root location. A basic Newton-Raphson iteration is implemented in the cell below. The first few iterations are performed manually, and then we see how to automate the process with a while loop, which will continue to iterate until our specified criteria are met. You can see how quickly it converges for this simple example.  This is much, much better than a simple guess and check strategy."

    "### Initial Guess Sensitivity and NaN errors in Problem 04\n",
    "\n",
    "Although tools like `opt.newton` and `opt.root` are very easy to use, numerical solution of algebraic equations can be very tricky.  As a rule of thumb, the more equations that you are solving, and the more nonlinear these equations are, the more challening the numerical solution will be.  Usually, you need good-to-great initial guesses in order to solve difficult systems on nonlinear equations with numerical tools. Below, we demonstrate how certain initial guesses would cause the solver to go off the rails. This problem is hard because visualizing it would require us to work in 4 dimensions since we have $f1(x, y, z)$, etc. So providing good initial guesses can be tricky. In a physical system, we usually have limits on the variables that I can use to provide a better guess. For example, fractional conversions and mole fractions are between 0 and 1; absolute temperatures can't be less than zero; a temperature of 8000C is unrealistic in a chemical process; a pressure of 50000000 atm is unrealistic in a chemical process, etc. Here, it's just a math problem, so we have no idea how to bound $(x, y, z)$ without putting in a bit of effort (not a topic for this course).\n",

    "Will cause the solver to issue a warning since it ends up passing a negative value to the logarithm in the second equation, which is undefined (notice that it still converges, though. It gets around the `nan` (\"not a number\") error here). Astute readers will point out that $-5*-5 = 25$, so the negative signs should cancel, allowing us to evaluate the natural logarithm. This is true at the start, but, remember, these are iterative processes. We make initial guesses, and those guesses bias our solutions.  Just because the solver starts out with $y$ and $z$ both negative (and with a positive product), it won't necessarily stay here.  We demonstrate this in the cell below.  You can see that it hits places where only one of the two is negative; hence the error.\n",
