    "Numpy arrays are a bit different than what you're used to working with if you come from Matlab or Octave. Unless you take special steps to define a higher dimensional structure, pretty much everything in Matlab is treated as a matrix by default in that it has 2 dimensions: rows and columns.  Even a \"scalar\" in Matlab is a 1x1 matrix.  So, if you are coming to Python from Matlab, you're probably used to a language where everything has a row and column specification. Numpy arrays are a little different."

    "At some point, you may find yourself wanting to build either a \"Row\" or \"Column\" vector in Python. Before you try to do this, it is important to understand that rows ($1 \\times n$) and columns ($m \\times 1$) have 2 dimensions, even though they sort of look like a 1D structure. A Row has 1 row and n columns, and a column has m rows and 1 column. Usually, we don't *actually* need a structure that has the true 2D shape of a row or a column. Unless we are doing something particular with a linear algebra operation, we probably aren't overly concerned about whether things are rows are columns, so we can typically get away with creating a 1 dimensional array instead. Analogous to the above discussion about rows and columns being true 2D structures that have both a \"length\" and \"width,\" it is also important to understand that 1D arrays are truly 1 dimensional, and they only have a \"length\" associated with them. They do not have a second dimension, so they are neither a row nor a column. When I last worked in Matlab, there was no such thing as a 1D array, so this dimensionality was new to me in Python and thus confusing. \n",

If we ever need to create either a row or a column in Python, we have to remember that each of these things has a two dimensional shape associated with it.

In this case, the X matrix would be 20 x 2; the Y matrix would be 20 x 1, and we would be trying to find unknown coefficients for the straight line (slope and intercept) that solves this equation:\n",
